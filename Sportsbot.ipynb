What are the symptoms?\\nThe most common symptoms of Coronavirus are fever, cough and difficulty in breathing. \\nSome patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or \\ndiarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become \\ninfected but don’t develop any symptoms and dont’t feel unwell. Most people (about \\n80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. People with fever \\ncough and difficulty in breathing should seek medical attention immediately.\\n3. How does Coronavirus spread?\\nPeople can catch Coronavirus from others who have the virus. The disease can \\nspread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which \\nare spread when a person with Coronavirus coughs or exhales. These droplets land \\non objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch Coronavirus \\nby first touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. \\nPeople can also catch Coronavirus if they breathe in from a person with Coronavirus \\nwho coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than  \\n1 meter away from a person who is sick.\\n4. How to prevent Coronavirus?\\nWash your hands with soap \\nwater regularly.\\nThrow used tissues into \\nclosed bins immediately after \\nuse.\\nIf soap and water is not \\navailable, use hand sanitiser \\nwith at least 60 per cent alcohol.\\nCover your nose and mouth \\nwith handkerchief/tissue while \\nsneezing and coughing.\\nWash hands before touching \\neyes, nose and mouth.\\nAvoid mass gathering and \\ncrowded places.\\nFor more information, refer to — \\nhttps://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/FacilitatorGuideCOVID19_27%20March.pdf\\nChap-1.indd   4 8/28/2020   4:45:57 PM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Personality \\nstarts developing since birth, but it assumes great importance \\nduring adolescence, when reorganisation of personality takes \\nplace. \\nPersonality is a very common term which is used in our \\nday-to-day life. It tells us what type of person one is. We know \\nthat each person generally behaves consistently in most of the \\nsituations. The examples of this consistency can be seen in \\na person who remains friendly or a person who is generally \\nkind or helpful in most situations. Such a consistent pattern of \\nbehaviour is termed as personality. It can be called as the sum \\ntotal of behaviour that includes attitudes, emotions, thoughts, \\nhabits and traits. This pattern of behaviour is characteristic to \\nan individual. \\nThere are various dimensions of personality. These \\ndimensions are related to physical, emotional, intellectual, \\nsocial and spiritual aspects of our behaviour. For a holistic \\npersonality development, yoga plays an important role.\\n9.2 Yoga and PersonalItY develoPment\\nYogic practices are found effective for development of all \\ndimensions of personality. \\nLet us talk about the yogic practices that influences \\ndevelopment of different dimensions of personality.\\nYoga and Physical Dimension of Personality:  Physical \\ndimension is related to our body. It means that all organs and \\nsystems of our body should be properly developed and function. \\nIt implies a healthy body without any disease. Yogic practices \\nlike asana, pranayama, and bandha play a beneficial role in \\nphysical development of children. There is a series of asanas \\nand pranayamas which help to improve the functioning of the \\nbody.\\nYoga and Emotional Dimension of Personality: Yogic practices \\nare effective for development of emotional dimension related to \\nour feelings, attitudes and emotions. There are two kinds of  \\nemotions : positive and negative.

Similarly, our feelings and attitudes may \\nbe positive and negative. For emotional development, positive \\nfeelings, attitudes and emotions should be developed and \\nnegative ones should be controlled, as the negative attitudes \\nand emotions work as a mental block for the development \\nof personality. Yoga plays a critical role in development of \\npositive emotions. It  brings emotional stability. It helps to \\ncontrol negative emotions. Yogic practices such as yama, \\nniyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara and meditation help \\nin emotional management. For example, the principle of  \\nnon-violence will protect us from negative emotions and \\ndevelop positive feelings of love and kindness. Similarly, other \\nprinciples of yama and niyama will help to develop positive \\nemotions and attitudes in our personal and social life and \\ntherefore help in the management of emotions. \\nYoga and Intellectual Dimension of Personality: Intellectual \\ndevelopment is related to the development of our mental abilities \\nand processes such as critical thinking, memory, perception, \\ndecision making, imagination, creativity, etc.  Development of \\nthis dimension is very important as it enables us to learn new \\nthings and acquire knowledge and skills. Yogic practices such \\nas asana, pranayama, dharana, dhyana (meditation) help to \\ndevelop concentration, memory and thereby help in intellectual \\ndevelopment.\\nYoga and Social Dimension of Personality: Primary \\nsocialisation, probably the most important aspect of the \\npersonality development takes place during infancy, usually \\nwithin the family. By responding to the approval and disapproval \\nof parents and grandparents and imitating their examples, the \\nchild learns the language and many of the basic behaviour \\npatterns of her/his society. The process of socialisation is not \\nlimited to childhood, but continues throughout life and  teach \\nthe growing child and adolescent about the norms and rules of \\nthe society in which she/he lives . Some key elements of this \\nprocess include respect for others, listening carefully to other \\npersons, being interested in them, and voicing your thoughts \\nand feelings politely, honestly and clearly so that you can be \\neasily heard and understood. Principles of yama include these \\nkey elements and are very important as these help us in the \\nbetterment of our relationships with our friends, parents, \\nteachers and others.\\nYoga and Spiritual Dimension of Personality: This dimension \\nis related to the development of values. It is also concerned \\nwith self-actualisation which is related to recognising one’s \\npotential and developing them to the maximum.

It can be \\ndone any time on an empty stomach. However, morning is \\nconsidered to be the best time for it. Adolescents should start \\ndoing surya namaskara daily to have healthy body and mind.\\nYama (Restraint) and Niyama (Observance)\\nYama and Niyama are  principles which need to be adopted \\nalways in our day-to-day life. These can be considered as \\nthe universal codes of conduct that help us in following high \\nstandards in our personal and social life. Principles of yama \\nare concerned with one’s social life; while the principles of \\nniyama are concerned with one’s personal life. Yama and \\nniyama are part of Ashtanga yoga.\\nThe five principles of yama are: Ahimsa (non-violence), \\nSatya (truthfulness); Asteya (non\\n-stealing); Brahmcharya \\n(abstinence) and Aparigraha (non-collectiveness).\\nThe five principles of \\nniyama are: Shaucha (cleanliness); \\nSantosha (satisfaction); Tapas (austerity); Swadhyaya \\n(study of good literature and knowing about the 'self') and \\nIshwarpranidhana (dedication to the God/Supreme power).\\nChapter-9 Yoga.indd   121 08-11-2016   11:41:56 AM\\n2024-25\"),\n",

In order to \\npacify and relax the mind, it is to be stilled. This can be done \\nby taking the mind away from the external things. \\nFor pacifying and relaxing the mind, meditation is a very \\neffective practice.  It relaxes body and mind both and refuels \\nthem with energy. Several researches indicate that meditation \\nimproves the functioning of brain. \\nThere are several techniques of meditation. They vary in \\nthe methodology but the goal of all techniques is same, i.e., \\nreaching an inner calm and a higher level of awareness.

There is not just one reason for these,  part of the \\nproblem is that people ignore ethics while making decisions. \\nIt is in this context that ethics occupy a critical place. In the \\npresent chapter we shall discuss various dimensions of sports \\nethics.  \\n8.2 What Is sports EthIcs? \\nBefore discussing various dimensions of sports ethics, it is \\nimportant to understand the meaning of ethics.  Ethics, morals \\nand values are used interchangeably in everyday language, \\nthough these terms are not synonyms. The concept of ethics is \\ntechnically understood as a branch of philosophy that defines \\nwhat is good for the individual and society and establishes the \\nnature of obligations, or duties, that people owe themselves \\nand to one another. But without going into the complexities of \\nthis concept, it is relevant to understand ethics as the practice \\nof making principled choices between right and wrong: a code \\nof conduct that guides human behaviour, a set of standards \\nthat guides our conduct. It is generally viewed as the system \\nor set of rules, norms or laws by which attitudes and actions \\nare determined to be either “right or wrong”. The fundamental \\nproblem of ethics is determining what constitutes proper \\nconduct. It defines how individuals, professionals in different \\nfields, organisations, associations, federation and corporations \\nchoose to interact with one another.  \\nIn view of the above, sports ethics is a positive concept \\nthat guides human action in sports. It is defined as the code \\nof conduct for promoting and ensuring healthy sporting \\npractices. Sports ethics signifies not just a certain form of \\nbehaviour but also a particular way of thinking. It promotes \\nfair play among children and young persons via educational \\nand preventive measures and encourages the dissemination \\nof good practices to promote diversity in sport and combat all \\nforms of discrimination. \\nEvery child and young person has the right to play sport \\nand games to gain satisfaction from the experience. The code \\nof sports ethics applies to all levels of skills and commitment, \\nrecreational activities as well as competitive sport. It involves \\nthe elimination of all types of negative behaviour on and off \\nthe field. More importantly, it promotes equity and sporting \\nexcellence. \\nSports ethics is also focused on equity in sport which should \\nbe an expression of human excellence. It has two dimensions:\\nBox 8.1\\nBox 8.2\\nEthics is much \\nmore than playing \\nwithin the rules, \\nas it covers notions \\nsuch as friendship, \\nrespect for others \\nand the sporting \\nspirit.\\nInstitutions and \\nadults must be the \\nguarantors of the \\nright to play sport \\nand games.\\nChapter-8 Ethics in sports.indd   110 18-11-2016   4:42:29 PM\\n2024-25'),\n",

Health of children is very important as \\nthey constitute a large percentage of our population. In this \\nendeavour, school education plays an important role. Right to \\nEducation Act 2009 has very categorically focused on the role \\nof school in holistic development and health of children in the \\nage group  of 6-14 years. Therefore, health and physical fitness \\nneeds to be looked into at different levels of schooling.  Health \\nand Physical Education (including Yoga) is an integral part of the \\nschool curriculum, towards an overall development of the child.  \\nWith this view, the National Council of Educational Research \\nand Training (NCERT) is in the process of developing textbooks \\non Health and Physical Education for Classes IX and X.\\nThe present textbook – Health and Physical Education for Class \\nIX, focuses on a holistic understanding of health highlighting \\nimportance of exercise, games and sports, nutrition and the \\nenvironment. This book also provides a scope to discuss the \\npsycho-social and mental health related issues of children and \\ncollective responsibilities for healthy community living. Given \\nthe interdisciplinary nature of this subject, cross references \\nhave also been mentioned. \\nGiven the inter-related nature of the concepts covered in the \\narea of Health and Physical Education, the presentation is made \\nin a cohesive and integrated manner, rather adopting fragmentary \\napproach. Experiential learning activities for acquiring skills for \\nhealthy living are made an integral part of the book.\\nNCERT appreciates the hard work done by the Textbook \\nDevelopment Committee. I am highly thankful to Professor \\nSaroj Yadav, Dean (Academic) and Project Coordinator of \\nNational Population Education Project (NPEP) and Adolescence \\nEducation Programme (AEP) for her continuous effort to develop \\nthis material in the present form.

There are muscles that contract to cause \\nmovements according to one’s will. These are called voluntary \\nmuscles, such as, those of the limbs and the neck. The \\ninvoluntary muscles, such as, those lining the food canal, \\nmove automatically without our efforts for making them move. \\nAnother kind of muscles, which are also involu\\nntary, are the \\nmuscles of the heart or cardiac muscles which never stop \\ncontracting and relaxing. As learnt in earlier classes, muscle \\ncells (muscle fibres) may be striated (voluntary) muscle fibres, \\nunstriated (involuntary) muscle fibres and cardiac muscle \\nfibres (Fig.2.4). Muscles are grouped into bundles enclosed in a \\nmembrane. Movement of muscles takes place by the movement \\nof molecules of muscle proteins, called actin and myosin present \\nin the muscle fibres. Upon receiving instructions from the brain \\nand nerves, these proteins slide over each other and the muscle \\ncontracts. Muscle contraction uses up energy, which comes \\nfrom food. It is measured in calories.\\nEnergy producing organ systems\\nThrough digestive system, food gets digested and \\nconverted to a form, which can be broken down \\nin the cell to release energy. Respiratory system \\nensures a continuous supply of Oxygen to each and \\nevery cell of the body for oxidation of food.

Strong muscles also give stability \\nand improve balance and coordination during movements. \\nPhysical activities also improve blood supply to the muscles \\nand increase their capacity to use oxygen.\\nMuscles and muscle performance \\nPhysical activities if undertaken regularly have beneficial \\neffects on the muscular system. Whenever physical activities, \\ngames or sport are undertaken there is contraction of muscles \\nand increase in energy level due to breakdown of ATP. \\nThe beneficial effects of regular physical activities are \\nlisted below —\\n • Change in shape and size of the muscle fibres: Muscle \\nfibres enlarge with physical activities which cause an \\noverall enlargement of muscles with the change in \\nits size and shape. The size of muscles increases by  \\n60 per cent.  It is because of this reason that, the \\nmuscles of arms of a tennis player are well developed.\\n • Maintenance of muscle tone: Muscles are stimulated \\nto contract by signals from nerves. Due to continuous \\nsignals, when physical exercises are undertaken, \\nmuscles remain in partial state of contraction called \\nmuscle tone. Hence, regular physical activities maintain \\ngood muscle tone and enhance physical fitness.\\n • Increase in muscle proteins: The units of muscle \\ncontraction are proteins. Physical activities lead to \\nincrease in total proteins.\\n • Increase in blood capillaries: Regular physical exercises \\nlead to increase in number of blood capillaries supplying \\nblood to muscles.\\n • Increase in efficiency of ligaments and tendons: \\nLigaments and tendons become more efficient as a \\nresult of regular physical activity. This improves muscle \\nmovements resulting in greater tolerance of stress \\nduring strenuous activity.\\n • Long term increase in muscle strength: Regular physical \\nexercises increase and maintain strength of muscles. \\nThis increases speed of contraction as in the case of \\nmarathon runner and also work well against load as in \\nthe case of weight lifter.\\n • Delay in muscle fatigue: Muscles need oxygen to \\ncontract. But when muscles are used for a long time \\nduring sport, available oxygen gets used up and \\nlactic acid accumulates. This causes muscle fatigue. \\nIt is, therefore, important to do physical activities like \\nstretching to delay muscle fatigue.\\nChap-2.indd   17 8/24/2020   1:09:28 PM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Healthy muscles give the body a \\nbeautiful shape.\\nOxygen Debt\\nDuring physical activities, respiratory rate increases.  At the \\nsame time, oxygen gets speedily used up, this creates an oxygen \\ndebt, as the rate of oxygen intake may not match the oxygen \\nrequirement due to the exercise. Thus, maximum exercises are \\nfollowed by a recovery period when oxygen debt is removed by \\nobtaining more oxygen.  For example, when an athlete is running \\nand requires 3 litres of oxygen, if oxygen obtained is only 2 litres, \\noxygen debt of 1 litre is created, which gets recovered during \\nrecovery period.\\n • Overall improvement in efficiency of muscle movements \\nand reaction time:  Muscles contract on receiving \\nstimulus from nerves.

It is an \\nincrease in secretion of sex hormones (testosterone in males, \\nestrogen and progesterone in females). Puberty merges into \\nadolescence at around 10 years of age, and adolescence \\ngenerally lasts till 19 years of age. You may recall the \\ndiscussion on adolescence in the chapters of your Class VIII \\ntextbook of science and the Class IX textbook of Health and \\nPhysical Education.\\nDuring this phase, significant physical and psychological \\nchanges take place. However, as you have already learnt in \\nyour previous classes, the timing of these changes varies \\nwith every individual.\\nUnique features of adolescence \\nThe two unique features of adolescence are —\\n (i) The spurt in physical growth, when a physical \\nappearance of an individual gradually becomes \\ndifferent. This is due to the rapid acceleration in \\ngrowth of skeletal tissue (bones and cartilage) and \\nmuscular and glandular tissue. For examples, breasts \\nbegin to develop in girls due to the release of estrogen \\nhormone. Changes in voice are quite noticeable \\namong boys.\\n (ii) It is a time period between the onset of puberty and \\nadulthood. \\nGrowth spurt in adolescents \\nAs you would have experienced yourself, the changes during \\nadolescence occur speedily and alter the body size and shape \\nof adolescents. Suddenly the child seems to have grown up \\ninto a young adult. This is called growth spurt and is shown \\nthrough the following flow chart.\\nChap-3.indd   24 8/24/2020   4:15:38 PM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Sex hormones stimulate growth and maturity of \\ngonads (reproductive organs).  In males, testes grow in size and \\nstart producing sperms. In females, the eggs or ova present \\nin the ovary since birth begins to mature.  Sex organs also \\nincrease in size. Thus, there is an overall growth in body size.  \\nAs sexual maturity progresses during adolescence, hormones \\nact on growth centers of bones which are responsible for \\nincrease in length of bones. The long bones, the vertebrae \\nand limbs grow and the adolescent gains height. The limbs \\nbecome stronger. The heart, lungs and other internal organs \\nalso grow to match the increase in body size. The muscle \\nmass undergoes a spurt at adolescence. Eventually, growth \\nrate slows down and then stops. Generally, at the age of 14 \\nto 18 years of age, adult height is already reached. The peak \\nof growth of muscle mass is also typically around the age of \\n14 to 16 years. In the females, the pelvis region undergoes a \\ngrowth spurt and becomes wider.\\nsecondAry sexuAl chArActeristics\\nIn earlier classes, you h ave learnt about secondary sexual \\ncharacteristics.

During this transitional period the adolescents \\nget confused regarding their emerging role in the family \\nand society at large. The physical changes in adolescents \\nare accompanied by psychosocial changes. Adolescents get \\nattracted towards opposite sex or become part of a peer \\ngroup.

Adolescents are more friendly with their \\npeer group. However belonging to a vulnerable age group, \\nadolescents may feel pressurised under the influence of \\npeers.

This may hamper proper care of the infant.\\nActivity 3.3\\nRead the case study given below. Think and answer the questions \\nthat follow. \\nRahul’s grandmother and Sangeeta’s grandmother were great \\nfriends. When Rahul grew up, his grandmother would often ask \\nhim to drop Sangeeta at her home. As a result Rahul and Sangeeta \\ndeveloped a liking for each other. When Sangeeta turned sixteen, \\nthe grandmothers insisted that Rahul and Sangeeta be married \\noff as they were developing a relationship and that people would \\ntalk about it. Rahul was in college and Sangeeta had yet to \\nfinish school when they got married. After six months Sangeeta \\ndiscovered that she was pregnant. Sangeeta was sad as she had \\ndreams of pursuing higher studies and a career.\\n1.\\n Were Rahul and Sangeeta right in agreeing \\nto get married? \\nGive reasons for your answer.\\n2.

While you must maintain hygiene of all \\nexternal parts, the internal organs also have to function \\nnormally. You know that certain vital functions of the body \\nfor enjoying good health are maintenance of blood pressure, \\npulse rate, respiratory rate, etc. Some ways of assessing \\nthe vital functions and statistics of human beings are  \\ngiven below. \\nBlood pressure (BP) and its measurement\\nPressure exerted \\nby blood on the \\nwall of the arteries \\nis called blood \\npressure. When \\nthe heart \\ncontracts, blood \\nsurges through \\naorta, BP is \\nhighest (Systolic \\nPressure) \\npressure \\nof blood on the arterial wall recorded when ventricles relax is \\nlowest (Diastolic Pressure).\\nThe pressure wave \\nalong the arteries with \\neach heartbeat can be \\nfelt at the pulse. Blood \\npressure is measured \\nby the instrument \\ncalled “Sphygmoma-\\nnometer”. Diastolic \\nand Systolic pressure \\nis measured and in a \\nnormal healthy young \\nadult it is 110/75, \\nwhich means 110 \\nmm Hg systolic and \\n75 mm Hg diastolic. \\nSphygmomanometer \\nconsists of cuff with \\nan inflatable bladder which is wrapped around a person’s up -\\nper arm and a rubber bulb inflates the bladder. An attached \\ndevice indicates the blood pressure. There is now a digital de -\\nvice which is also used for measuring the BP. BP increases \\nwith age to about 130/90mm Hg.

During the course of a raid, the \\nraider will move in different angles, according \\nto the positions and moves of the opponents. \\nAt the same time, in order to apply this skill, \\nthe raider requires to extend his leg towards \\nthe opponent suddenly. \\n (iii) Foot touch: The modern toe touch is a \\nmoderate form of foot-touch. The major \\ndifference between these two skills is that \\nin foot-touch, the raider tries to touch the \\nopponents with complete foot whereas in toe \\ntouch, toe is used to touch the opponents. \\nThis skill helps the raider to cover more \\narea in the opponent’s court and has an \\nadvantage over toe touch.\\n b) Mule kick: It is very useful in critical situations. \\nMule kick is a thrust or blow in the air, by the \\nraider, with leg, to touch an anti. There are various \\ntypes of kicks, such as — \\n i. Back kick: Kicking the anti who comes behind \\nthe raider during the course of raid is known \\nas back kick. The different forms of back kick \\nare: (i) running back kick (ii) standing back \\nkick (iii) fake and kick (iv) taking a turn and \\nback kick.\\n ii. Side kick: Raiders who raid from second to \\nsecond and attack the central zone will find \\nthis skill the most suitable. The method and \\nprinciple of kick are the same as in the case \\nof back kick. The only difference between \\nthe two is that the area to be covered is \\nsideward.\\n iii. Curve kick is also called a mule kick as the \\nleg lifted to kick at the anties takes a curve \\nfrom back to the side. This type of kick will \\nenable the raider to cover more area with the \\nattacking leg. At the same time it enables the \\nraider to change his direction. \\n  Defensive skills\\n a) Ankle hold: This is a counter skill used by \\ndefensive players against leg thrusts and foot \\ntouches during an attack or raid. A team, which \\nhas mastery over ankle hold, can plan different \\nstrategies and tactics in various situations, such \\nas, (a) lifting up (b) pulling back (c) changing \\ndirection of the raider.\\nChap-7.indd   116 8/24/2020   11:41:01 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

For example: (a) Taking one \\nstep forward and hold — Taking one step forward \\nmeans holding the raider’s thigh on wrong step or \\nrear leg (b) thigh hold from behind.\\n c) Waist hold or trunk hold: Waist hold is a skill used \\nby a defender to catch the raider from behind.\\n d) Wrist hold: Wrist hold is also a defensive skill and \\nused occasionally only when a situation presents \\nitself. This hold is rarely used now a days.\\n e) Blocking: It is a defensive skill used by covers \\nand corners. Blocking is an act of creating a \\nwall of obstruction in the path of the raider to \\nprevent the movement.

In order to do this the player \\nmay adopt a passive raid or an aggressive raid by creating a \\nsituation for a struggle. Sometimes the raider may pass time \\nin the last few minutes of the game, especially when the team \\nis leading and the opponents are playing an aggressive game. \\nKeeping in view the game situation, different tactics adopted \\nby the raider.\\nRetreat\\nUnless the raider returns to home court safely after the raid, \\nthe raid cannot be treated as successful. This is called a \\nretreat. The raider has to pre-plan the path of retreat before \\nstarting the raid. While retreating to home court, the raider \\nshould keep the following points in view —\\n • The raider does not give room for pursuit.\\n • The raider regains their defensive position quickly \\nbefore the opponent team’s raider begins the raid.\\n • While returning to home court, the raider must pass \\nonly through the midline.\\nRaid\\nRaid is the offence part of the game. The main feature of \\nthe game is raiding on the opponent’s court, alternatively by \\nboth the team players. The defence is done with teamwork \\nwhile only one player makes an attack.\\nChap-7.indd   117 8/24/2020   11:41:01 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

In the term judo, ‘ju’ means \\n‘gentle’ and ‘do’ means ‘the way or path’.  \\nJudo was developed in Japan in the late 19th \\ncentury by using the principles of balance and \\nleverage adapted from jujutsu. Its most prominent \\nfeature is its competitive element, where the \\nobjective is to either throw or putdown one’s \\nopponent to the ground, immobilise or otherwise \\nsubdue one’s opponent with a grappling maneuver, \\nor force an opponent to submit by joint locking or \\nby executing a stranglehold or choke. Strikes and \\nthrusts by hands and feet as well as self-defense \\nare a part of judo. Many are trained in Judo either \\nfor participation in competition or self-defense.\\nHistory\\nThe history of judo starts with Japanese jujutsu. It was \\ncreated by Professor Jigoro Kano and he believed that the \\ntechniques could be practiced as a competitive sport if the \\nmore dangerous techniques were omitted. By 1910 Judo was \\na recognised sport that could be safely engaged in and in \\n1911 it was adopted as a part of Japan’s educational system. \\nIn the same year, the Kodokan Judo Instructors’ Training \\nDepartment, Kodokan Black Belt Association and Japan \\nAthletic Association were formed. World War II saw a different \\ndevelopment of Judo. Instead of being used for sport, Judo was \\nbeing taught as a combat skill. Those selected for commando \\nand special services training often achieved a high standard \\nof expertise. When Japan hosted the 1964 Olympics, Judo \\nwas given its first opportunity as an event. Of the 16 medals \\nawarded for Judo, Japan won three gold medals, and one \\nsilver medal. Judo was no longer a Japanese sport but had \\ndeveloped to become an international sport. \\nThere have been two main developments in Judo over the \\nyears. The first was the introduction of weight categories. \\nEarlier everyone fought everyone else, with the result that, \\nif two players were equally matched in skill, the bigger man \\nusually won. Initially there were three categories, and later \\nthis was made into five. Inclusion of the sport in the Olympic \\nGames in 1964 helped to hasten this important reform.  \\nThere are different styles of Judo. With its inclusion in the \\nOlympics, there has been a shift towards a contest style \\npractice. In clubs where this style is taught, the practice \\nbecomes largely a continuous contest. Other schools stress \\non skills. They favour repetitive movements to make them \\ninstinctive and the development of speed through practice \\nwith little resistance. \\nFig. 7.5: Player playing Judo\\nChap-7.indd   122 8/24/2020   11:41:04 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

There \\nis one referee who walks around inside the contest area and \\nconducts the match. There are two judges who sit diagonally \\nacross the mat from one another, each in a corner. The two \\njudges assist the referee and indicate when the contestant \\ngoes outside of the contest area. The referee is in charge \\nof awarding points and accessing penalties and uses hand \\ngestures to signal his decision. However, if a judge disagrees \\nwith a call, then the three officials take a vote and the decision \\nis decided by a majority vote. In addition to the Judge and \\nReferees there are also scorekeepers and timers. There is \\nusually a scoreboard, which displays points and penalties \\nand it can either be electronic or manual. Medical personnel \\nare also on hand in the event of injury to a contestant. \\nContestants\\nThe two contestants, who are known as Judokas, compete for \\n5 minutes for men and 4 minutes for women. One contestant \\nwears white uniform and the other a blue uniform. \\nUniforms\\nThe judokas wear loose-fitting judo uniforms called judogi, \\nconsisting of pants, a jacket and a belt. Judogi is made up \\nof loose-fitting pants, a jacket and a belt that is tied around \\nthe waist. The jacket and pants are made of cotton. They \\nare either blue or white and they are made so a rival should \\nbe able to get a grip on either one of them so as to be able \\nto make a judo throw. One judoka will wear white the other \\nblue. The belt is three meters long and it is wrapped around \\nthe waist twice. The color of the belt signifies the rank the \\ncombatant has reached. \\nCompetition area\\nThe entire competition area in judo is 46 to 53 feet square  \\n(14 to 16 meters). This area is made up of foam mats \\ncommonly referred to as tatami mats and the individual \\nmats are 6.5 feet by 3.281 feet wide (2 meters long, a 1-meter \\nwide). Inside the competition area is a contest area, which \\nis 8-10 meters square. This contest area (shiaijo) is green in \\ncolor, that would be 29.5 feet square (9-meters) and it will \\nhave a 3.281 foot (1-meter) red boundary around it. This is \\nthe danger zone and it alerts the competitor(s) (judoka) that \\nthey are about to go out of bounds. The area outside the \\ndanger zone is the safety zone. This zone is three meters wide \\nand it is the out-of-bounds area.\\nChap-7.indd   123 8/24/2020   11:41:04 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

In \\nthe Olympic Games there are two pools, and each pool has \\nits own single-elimination tournament. The two pool winners \\nwill compete for the gold medal, with the loser of this contest \\nwinning the silver medal.

In the event of a tie, for the \\nfirst time at the 2004 Olympic Games, the “Golden Score” \\nrule was used. If there is no winner after the five-minute \\nperiod has ended, the referee announces the beginning of \\n“Golden Score”. This will extend the match for an extra five-\\nminute period and the contestant who scores the first point \\nis declared the winner of the match.\\nJudo penalties\\nTwo types of penalties may be awarded.

Wrestling in India \\ncontinued to increase its popularity during modern days. Even \\nduring the British rule, wrestling in India got encouraging \\nsupport, as the British rulers included the game into the \\nmilitary practice. In fact, India was considered among the \\ntop 10 countries in wrestling till the 1960s. India also hosted \\nthe World Wrestling Championship at New Delhi in 1967.\\nThe term Kushti, which means wrestling, denotes both a \\nlocal form of the art as well as a more global combat. Kushti \\nis composed of three primary dimensions: dao, pench, and \\npaintra (moves, counter-moves, and stance). There may \\nbe similarities between the daos known as multani, dhobi \\npat, and kalajangh and the corresponding freestyle moves \\nknown as arm drag, front hip throw, and fireman carry. But \\nwhat is significantly different about wrestling in India is \\nthat wrestlers mostly wrestle in mud pits, engage in bouts \\nthat last for half an hour or more. At other times and under \\nother circumstances Indian wrestlers follow clearly defined \\ninternational guidelines, rules, and regulations.\\nDo You Know?\\nIn 2008, Sushil Kumar \\nbrought 2nd Bronze \\nMedal for India at Beijing \\nOlympic Games.

With the passage \\nof time, they started to live in a society and developed a \\nlanguage for interaction with each other. As ‘human society’ \\nprogressed, an individual became part of many social groups \\nfor example a member of a peer group, a family and kin, a class \\nin school, a native of a region and a citizen of one’s country. \\nSocial changes occur from time to time and many societies \\nlay down norms and values for group living.

Later the YMCA established at Madras \\nin 1920 played an important role in the development of \\nthis game. Today basketball is one of the most favourite \\ngames in many schools and colleges. The game is played \\nby both men and women of all ages and ability. In order \\nto promote Basketball at National and International levels \\nthe Basketball Federation of India was set up in 1950.

Cricket became a generally \\nadopted sport in the second half of the seventeenth century. \\nThe Hambeldon club which was founded in about 1750’s \\nhad played a significant part in the evolution of the game. \\nIt was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C) \\nwith its headquarters at Lords, London. Cricket became \\nan international game with the formation of the Imperial \\nCricket Conference (I.C.C) in 1909. The name of Imperial \\nCricket Conference was changed to International Cricket \\nConference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the \\ncommon wealth to become its members. The first Limited \\nOver International cricket match was played in 1971 at \\nMelbourne. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) \\nsaw its potential and staged the first limited over Cricket \\nWorld Cup in 1975. The first edition of limited over Cricket \\nworld cup won by West Indies. \\nIn the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty 20, \\nhas made an immediate impact. The first T-20 international \\nmatch took place on August 5 2004, between the women’s \\nteams of England and New Zealand. The first T-20 \\ninternational match between men’s teams was played on \\nFebruary 17 2005, between Australia and New Zealand. The \\nfirst T-20 World Cup was played in South Africa in 2007. \\nIndia won the first edition of T-20 World Cup.\\nAn all India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under \\nMaharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Indian Cricket \\nControl Board came into being towards the end of 1928. The \\nnational championship for the Ranji Trophy began in 1935. \\nIndia entered the international arena and played its first official \\nTest against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singhji \\nof Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies, \\nmade a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket. \\nMeasurement\\nMin 122cm\\nMin3.66 m2.64 m 3.05 m\\nReturn Crease\\nStumps\\nBowling Crease\\nPopping Crease\\n20.12 m (22 yds)\\nFig. 6.8: Specifications of cricket ground\\nChap-6.indd   84 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

One of the main \\ncricket rules for batsmen to score runs is that they must \\nrun to the pitch at each other’s end (from one end to the \\nother), hence score one run. Cricket rules state that, they \\nmay run multiple runs per shot. As well as while running \\nthey can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A batsman \\nhits a boundary and scores 4 or 6 runs. A four and six both \\nare scored by hitting the ball. If it crosses the boundary \\nafter touching the ground it is considered as four and if \\nthe ball crosses boundary before touching the ground it is \\nconsidered as six. Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 \\nhas been scored any runs physically scored by the batsman \\nby running between the wickets are null and void. \\nOther ways runs can be scored according to the cricket \\nrules include no balls, wide balls, byes and leg byes. Cricket \\nrules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded \\nto the batting team but not the individual batters.\\n • A No Ball can be declared for many reasons: If the \\nheel of the bowler’s front foot lands on or in front of \\nthe popping crease or if the bowler’s back foot touches \\nthen outside the return crease the ball is declared no \\nball. If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, \\nthe ball is declared dangerous (often happens when \\nbowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces \\nmore than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman \\nor if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The \\nbatsman can hit a No ball and score runs off it but \\ncannot be out from a No ball except if they are run \\nout, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the \\nfield. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no \\nball for his shot while the team also gains one run for \\nthe no ball itself.\\n • A Wide Ball will be declared if the umpire thinks the \\nbatsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to \\nscore off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled \\nover the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide \\nbut a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide \\ndeliveries in the shorter format of the game while being \\nmuch more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will \\nadd one run to the batting team and any runs scored \\nby the batsman. The batsman is not supposed to be \\ndeclared ‘out’ off a wide delivery except if they are \\nstumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or \\nobstruct the field.\\n • A Bye is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes \\nthe striking batsman and runs are scored without the \\nbatsman hitting the ball.\\nChap-6.indd   85 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

However no runs can be scored if the striking \\nbatsman didn’t attempt to play a shot or if he was \\navoiding the ball.\\nTypes of ‘out’ in cricket\\nWays batsmen can be given ‘Out’ according to cricket rules:\\nThere are a number of different ways a batsman can be given \\nout in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman \\nout it is said that the bowler gets a ‘wicket’. Following are the \\ndifferent ways, a batsman can be given out according to the \\nrules of cricket:\\nFig. 6.9: Bowled\\n • Bowled – Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled \\nand hits the striking batsman’s wickets the batsman is \\ngiven out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the \\nball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched \\nthe batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of \\nthe batsman. However, the ball is not allowed to have \\ntouched another player or umpire before hitting the \\nwickets.\\n • Caught – Cricket rules state that if a batsman while \\nplaying the ball, either it touches his bat, hand or glove \\nholding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. \\nThis is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler \\ncatching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this \\nis done then cricket rules state the batsman is out.\\n • Leg before Wicket (LBW) – If the ball is bowled and \\nhits the .batsman first without touching the bat, then \\nan LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to \\ngive this out he must first look at some of the factors \\nstated in the cricket rules.

However, if the ball hits the batsman outside the \\nline of off stump while he was attempting to play a \\nstroke then he is not out.\\n • Stumped – A batsman can be given out according to \\ncricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his \\nwicket while, he is out of his crease and not attempting \\na run (if he is attempting a run it would be a run out).\\n • Retired Out – A batsman leaves the field without the \\npermission of umpire for any resource like, illness, \\ninjury etc. Than is given as retired out. \\n • Run Out – Cricket rules state that a batsman is out \\nif no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the \\npopping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket \\nis fairly put down by the fielding side.\\n • Hit Wicket – Cricket rules specify that if a batsman \\nhits his wicket down with his bat or body after the \\nbowler has entered his delivery stride and the ball is in \\nplay then he is out. \\n • Handled the Ball – Cricket rules allow the batsman \\nto be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the \\nhand that is not touching the bat without the consent \\nof the opposition or umpire.\\n • Timed Out – An incoming batsman must be ready to \\nface a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner \\nwithin three minutes of the outgoing batsman being \\ndismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman \\ncan be given timed out.\\n • Hit the Ball Twice – Cricket rules state that if a \\nbatsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose \\nof protecting his wicket or with consent from the \\nopposition, he is out.\\n • Obstructing the Field – A batsman is out if he \\nintentionally obstructs the opposition by word or action\\nThere are many other cricket rules. However these are \\nmost of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing \\nthe game. Many of the more advanced rules and laws can be \\nlearned along the way and are not vital to general play.\\nIf any batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire’s \\nconsent for any reason other than injury or incapacity, \\nhe may resume the innings only with the consent of the \\nopposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he is out. \\nFor the purposes of calculating a batting average, retired out \\nis considered a dismissal.\\nChap-6.indd   87 8/24/2020   11:39:28 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

The bat comes down \\nin and arc from the top of the back lift and strikes the \\nball just in front of the left foot. \\n • After impact, the bat must continue in the arc and finish \\nover the left shoulder. The follow through can also be \\nchecked at shoulder height, keeping the bat face open. \\n • The head is kept straight and still throughout the shot \\nand the top hand and elbow controls the direction of \\nthe shot. At the time of impact the head should be \\nover the ball with the body weight balanced on the \\nfront foot.

The \\nbat is brought down close to the body with the head \\nsteady and over the ball. \\n • The back foot must remain parallel to the crease as \\nfar as possible to maintain the sideways position of \\nthe body with the top hand firm and in control, and \\nthe bottom hand holding the bat loosely.\\n • To keep the bat straight, the left elbow is held high \\nnext to the head.

Also commonly known as soccer, it is a game \\nthat involves kicking a ball with the foot to score a point. \\nIt is played between two teams with a spherical ball on a \\nrectangular field of grass or green artificial turf. There is a \\ngoal post at each end of the rectangular field and errected \\nat the middle of base line. Points are scored by moving the \\nball to an opposing team’s end of the field and putting it \\nbetween two goal posts. Players are required to move the ball \\nby kicking, dribbling, carrying, and passing. The team that \\nscores more points than the other by the end of the match \\nwins the game.\\nHistory\\nAccording to FIFA (Federation International de Football \\nAssociation), the “very earliest form of the game was played \\nin china during the second and third centuries. The game \\nwas later developed in England and the rules of football were \\nformulated in India, football began its journey when the \\nBritish rulers brought it with them and in no time it became \\npopular in the masses. The first recorded game here took place \\nbetween the ‘Calcutta Club of Civilians’ and the ‘Gentlemen \\nof Barrackpore’ in 1854. The first ever football club in India, \\nthe ‘Calcutta Football Club’ was founded in 1872. The first \\nfootball association, “the Indian Football Association” (IFA) \\nwas established in Calcutta in 1893, though there was no \\nIndian on its board till 1930s. It was later, replaced by All India \\nFootball Federation (AIFF). The Durand Cup Tournament is \\nthe oldest in India and the one of the oldest in the world, was \\nstarted in Shimla in 1888. The decade of 1951 to 1962 is \\nknown as the golden era in the history of Indian football, as \\nthe country put up commendable performances in a number \\nof international competitions. India won gold medals in 1951 \\nand 1962 Asian Games, held at New Delhi and Jakarta.\\n68-70 cm\\nCircumference\\nof football\\nFig. 6.14: Specifications of \\nfootball\\nChap-6.indd   93 8/24/2020   11:39:32 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

The \\nfootball match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each. \\nThere are several rules in the game of football regarding the \\nfield, players, penalties, offence and defence. \\nStart and restart of play\\nA coin toss takes place before the game starts, the winner of \\nthe toss will get the choice of choosing the end to attack. At \\nthe kick-off, all players from each side must be in their own \\nhalves of the field. The kick-off takes place on the centre spot \\nin the centre circle. The player who kicks off cannot touch it \\nagain until another player has made contact.\\nPunishment for offences\\nIf the player persistently offends during a match, the referee \\ncan choose to take action. First the Yellow Card as a caution \\nis shown to a player. Any offence after the second one leads \\nto Red card. If they showed a red card to a player it means \\nthat player is expelled from the match. A straight red card (no \\nprevious caution) can be shown for extreme offences, such \\nas, serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, deliberately \\nhandling the ball to prevent a goal, a professional foul (denying \\na goal scoring opportunity) and insulting language and/or \\ngestures.\\nFree kicks\\nWhenever a free kick is taken, the players on the opposite \\nside must be at least 10 yards away from the ball until it \\nis kicked. If this rule is not adhered to, the kick is retaken. \\nThere are two types of free kicks awarded, depending on the \\nnature of the offence: (i) Direct Free Kick — allows the team \\nto take a direct shot at the opponent`s goal. (ii) Indirect Free \\nKick — a direct strike on goal is not permitted. It means a \\nsecond player has to touch the ball after the kick is taken to \\nscore a goal.\\nPenalty kick\\nA penalty kick is awarded for offences taking place in the \\npenalty and goal areas. A nominated member of the team is \\nallowed to strike at goal from the penalty spot, with only the \\ngoalkeeper to beat. The goalkeeper must remain on his line \\nuntil the ball has been kicked, and all other players must be \\noutside the penalty area behind the penalty spot.

It \\ncannot go directly to the goalkeeper’s hands (if on the same \\nteam). A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.\\nCorner kick\\nA corner kick is awarded once the whole ball crosses the goal \\nline of the opposition, after touching one of their players. \\nA kick is taken from the corner of whichever side the ball \\ntravelled over the field. Opponents must be 10 yards from \\nthe corner arc and the kicker cannot touch the ball a second \\ntime without having touched by any other player.\\nFundamental skills\\nReceiving\\nReceiving a ball on the ground is different than receiving a \\nball in air. Keep your eye on the ball, select the foot to receive \\nthe ball, don’t stop the ball, prepare it for new action or move, \\nshot, dribble, pass.\\nPassing\\nPassing involves giving the ball to partners. Perfect decision \\nmaking is required before a perfect pass. Before pass,  \\nsee the target, approach the ball, and look at the ball holding \\nthe head steady.

Even though many ancient \\ncivilisations played hockey in different variations, the modern \\ngame of field hockey was developed in the British Isles in the \\n19th century. It was introduced in India by the British Army \\nregiments and the game soon became popular. It was during \\nthis time that the London Hockey Association was formed \\nand the rules for playing hockey were standardised. In 1924, \\nthe International Hockey Federation (FIH) was founded and \\nthree years later, the International Federation of Women’s \\nHockey followed.\\nIn India, the first hockey club came up in Calcutta in \\n1885-86 and soon Bombay and Punjab followed.

The hallmark of this ruthless domination was \\nthe wizardry of Indian hockey legend, Dhyan Chand, who \\nmesmerised the Amsterdam crowd with his dazzling skills. \\nFrom 1928 to 1956, India won six consecutive Olympic gold \\nmedals, while winning 24 consecutive matches.

Each team works together \\nto hit an inflated ball over a high net. Each team tries to \\nscore points by grounding the ball on the other team’s court. \\nVolleyball is a rebound game where one cannot hold or catch \\nthe ball; every contact must be a rebound action. It is essential \\nfor the player to be in the right place at the right time if \\nthe game is to be played in a controlled manner. Therefore,  \\ngood anticipation and movement skills should be taught \\nto players. At competency level, students should learn and \\npractice the basic skills of sending and receiving the ball over \\na high net. They should play simple 3 touch volleyball games \\nworking as a team to keep the ball in play and ground it on \\nthe opponent’s side of the court.\\nHistory\\nOriginally named Mintonette, it was created as a gentle indoor \\nsport for older players to be able to exert a bit of athletic \\neffort by keeping the ball in the air. The idea of using a net \\nwas borrowed from tennis. It was raised to a height above \\nthe average man’s height. During a demonstration game, \\nsomeone remarked that the players seemed to be volleying \\nthe ball back and forth over the net, and perhaps “volleyball” \\nwould be a more descriptive name for the sport. The game \\nof Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan in the year \\n1895 in Holyoke, Massachusetts by YMCA (USA). It was \\ninvented as a recreational game. This game was brought to \\nIndia more than 85 years ago when some physical education \\nChap-6.indd   102 8/24/2020   11:39:36 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Some other \\nsubstances also work in the same way and are not necessarily \\ndrugs.  The non-medical use of a substance including drugs, \\nthat changes an individual’s mental and physical status and \\naffect the health adversely, is known as substance abuse. \\nOnce a person starts using a substance, his mental state \\nis altered and the person cannot get out of this habit. The \\nextreme dependency on the substance compels them to  \\nincrease the intake every day. This is called addiction. \\nSubstance misuse is widespread today including \\nadolescents across the world.  Socially acceptable drugs \\nlike tobacco and alcohol abuse not only ruins the life of the \\nindividual but can also influence them to associated with \\ncrime and violence.\\nCommonly abused substances \\nThere are substances that can be abused for their mood-\\naltering effects such as inhalants and solvents. On the other \\nhand, there are drugs that can be abused that have no mood-\\naltering or intoxication properties, such as, anabolic steroids. \\nThey are abused by the adolescents and youth during body \\nbuilding, to look more muscular.\\nCommonly abused substances are tobacco, alcohol, \\nmarijuana (ganja), opium, cannabis, solvents (petrol, glue, \\ncorrection ink) and aerosols inhalants, cough syrup, caffeine, \\ncocaine and ecstasy.  There are other substances like gutka \\nand paan (betel). \\nThese substances can be ingested, inhaled, drunk, \\nchewed or injected by a syringe in the blood.  Some of these \\nsubstances make one addicted, even if taken once.\\nReasons for substance abuse in young people \\nYoung people are more vulnerable to substance abuse due to \\nthe following reasons —\\n • During the process of growing up, poor self-esteem, low \\nachievement at school, performance pressures, etc,. \\nare some of the factors that promote substance abuse \\nin adolescence.  Resorting to substance use as a means \\nof ‘growing up’ or fun also makes the adolescents more \\nvulnerable to substance abuse.\\n • Pressure from peers or friends to try an addictive \\nsubstance, the urge to gain popularity among friends, \\nand desire to experiment and curiosity to try out new \\nthings also make young people particularly vulnerable \\nto substance abuse.\\nChap-10.indd   188 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Now, he \\nis worried whether he will be able to keep up his performance \\nand score good grades in Class X. His parents always tell him \\nhow they expect to see him at the top of his class.  Afraid \\nof disappointing them, Sohan does not share his concerns \\nwith his parents. He feels that some of his friends may be \\ngoing through the same phase and discusses his problem with \\nthem. His friends suggest that smoking may reduce his stress \\nand help him to relax. Sohan wants to feel better and decides \\nto follow his friends’ advice. He starts smoking a cigarette or \\ntwo everyday.  Without realising, over a period of six months \\nhe was smoking 6-10 cigarettes a day. Smoking has become a \\nhabit with him, and in future, it was the cause of his ill health.\\nPoints for Discussion\\n a) What do you think is responsible for Sohan’s habit of \\nsmoking and why?\\n b) Do you think smoking helped reduce Sohan’s stress? \\nWhy?\\n c) What else could Sohan have done to reduce his stress \\neffectively? \\n d) What role could Sohan’s parents have played to prevent \\nhim from smoking? \\nConsequences of substance abuse\\nSubstance misuse leads to a number of short-term and long-\\nterm effects that are detrimental to health. \\nShort-term effects: These are effects that appear only \\na few minutes after the intake of substance. The user feels \\na false sense of well-being and a pleasant drowsiness.  \\nSome of the short-term effects are distorted vision, hearing \\nand coordination, impaired judgment, bad breath and \\nhangovers.\\nChap-10.indd   189 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

These effects show up over a course of time and are \\nusually caused by progressive damage to different body \\norgans. Some of the health consequences include irregular \\neating habits, sleep disorders, poor hygiene resulting in \\npoor health and low immunity. This predisposes substance \\nabuser to diseases and infections. \\nSubstance abuse in itself is not a cause of HIV/AIDS or \\nSTDs but under the influence of drugs, people may engage \\nin risk-behaviours that make them more susceptible to \\nthese infections. Injectable drug users, however, are more \\nprone to HIV in conditions where the users do not sterilise \\nneedles and share needles to inject the drug. \\nSubstance users may even die suddenly from a so-called \\noverdose, when one consumes more than what the body \\ncan tolerate. Death may also occur from long-term damage \\nto the organs of the body.\\nThese substances are especially harmful if consumed \\nduring pregnancy. These substances reach the foetus \\nthrough blood and harm it by crippling its growth and \\ndevelopment or death. \\nSubstance abuse influences not only the individual \\nand family but also the community. The persons who get \\naddicted often lose interest in other activities be it school, \\njob or any other responsibility. They are not able to take \\ncare of their responsibilities and may become a liability \\nfor their families and finally the society. Furthermore, it is \\nexpensive to buy substances or drugs on a regular basis. \\nHence, in desperation, addicted individuals may be forced \\nto engage in petty severe crimes. \\nPrevention of drug abuse\\nPaying attention to the following may prevent young people \\nfrom misusing substances —\\n • Peer pressure can be managed by being aware of \\nthe implications of substance abuse and developing \\nlife skills. One can not only save oneself from \\nadopting risky behaviours under peer pressure but \\nalso persuade the peers not to engage in unhealthy \\nbehaviours such as substance misuse. Advocacy \\nwith the involvement of local community can be quite \\nuseful.\\n • The different ways of dealing with negative peer \\npressure are saying ‘No’ assertively, making an \\nexcuse, reversal of pressure, and giving reasons.\\n • Young people should also be educated to recognise \\nthat a friend is someone who cares, protects and looks \\nActivity 10.6\\nDiscuss how a substance \\nabuser’s life gets affected.\\nChap-10.indd   190 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

The starting of the modern Olympic Games \\nat Greece in 1896 was marked as new era for track and \\nfield events which was initiated by Pierre-de-Coubertin.  \\nUntil the early 1920s, only males were participating in the \\ntrack and field events. Introduction of five track and field events \\nfor women in the athletics was started during 1928 Summer \\nOlympics. Gradually more women’s events were introduced as \\ntime progressed. However, it was only towards the second half \\nof the twentieth century that the men’s and women’s track and \\nfield events were given equal status. Furthermore, major track \\nand field events for disabled athletes were first introduced \\nat the 1960 Summer Para Olympics.

These include track events covering distances \\nof 100 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters, \\n4×100 meters relay, 4×400 meters \\nrelay, and hurdle races of 100 meters \\nfor women, 110 meters for men and 400 \\nmeters for both men and women. At the \\nprofessional level, sprinters begin the \\nrace by assuming a crouching position on \\nthe starting blocks. Then they lean their \\nbody forward and gradually move into an \\nupright position as the race progresses \\nand momentum is gained. Athlete remain \\nin the same lane on the running track \\nthroughout the sprinting distance. The \\nman or woman who runs fastest and takes \\nminimum time over 100m, wins the race. \\nThe winner is often named ‘the fastest man/woman in the \\ncompetition’. Some sprint events start in lanes, to cover the \\nsame distance for each runner.\\nMiddle distance\\nFig. 4.4: Middle distance running\\nThe middle distance races are of 800 meters and 1500 \\nmeters. Runners start the race from a standing start position \\nin the lanes along a curved starting line or in staggered lanes. \\nHowever the distance is same for each runner. After hearing \\nthe starter’s pistol, they head forward in the designated lane \\nor move towards the innermost track to follow the shortest \\nroute to the finish.

Middle-distance races require \\ndifferent skills and tactics to win the sprints competition. \\nThese races require that the athletes maintain a plateau \\npace, (i.e. the maintenance of speed at which the runner \\nis running) that allows for a final spurt of speed, whereas \\nsprint races need to be run at top speed for the entire length \\nof the race.\\nLong distance\\nThere are four common long distance running events in track and \\nfield. These are 3000 meters, 5000 meters and 10,000 meters \\nand 3000 meters steeplechase. Long distance track races have \\nmuch in common with middle distance races. However, in these \\nraces, pacing, endurance, and race tactics play an important \\nrole in performance. In these events, runners need to balance \\ntheir energy to win the race.\\nFig. 4.5: Long distance running\\nRelays\\nRelay races are the only track events in which a team of \\nrunners directly compete against other teams. Common relay \\nraces are the 4×100 meter and the 4×400 meter. The exchange \\nof baton takes place within a specified \\narea of the track called baton exchange \\nzone. Teams may be disqualified if the \\nteam fails to complete the baton exchange \\nwithin an area of 20 meters, the team is \\nconsidered as disqualified. A team may \\nalso be disqualified if its runners have \\ndeliberately created hurdle for the other \\ncompetitors. The 4×100 meter event is \\nrun strictly within the same lane on the \\ntrack.

Long jump: The long jump is one of the oldest field \\nevents. The take-off has to be made from a 20 cm \\nwide board one meter away from a pit.  Athletes \\nsprint along a length of track to a take off board and \\na sandpit. If any part of the runner’s foot goes past \\nthe takeoff board, the jumper is considered for a foul \\nand does not receive score for that round. Distance \\nis measured from the end of the takeoff board to the \\nnearest mark made by the jumper on the pit.  Best \\neight competitors have a maximum of six rounds. \\nProfessional long jumpers typically have strong \\nacceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes \\nmust also have a consistent stride to allow them to \\ntake off near the board while still maintaining their \\nmaximum speed.\\nFig. 4.11: Long jump\\n 2. Triple jump: Similar to the long jump, the triple jump \\ntakes place on a field heading towards a sandpit. \\nThis event is termed as the “hop-step and jump.” \\nThe event begins like a long jump, with competitor \\ndashing down the runway and leaping from a takeoff \\nboard they first hop then take a step and then jump \\ninto the pit. The event is scored identically to the  \\nlong jump.\\nChap-4.indd   43 8/24/2020   11:37:25 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

High jump: In high jump event, competitors combined \\nspeed, to generate lift, with jumping technique. \\nJumpers may approach the bar from either-side, \\nand land on a large, generally inflated cushion. In \\nbetween, they must clear the 4-meter-long bar \\nwithout knocking it off its supports. The bar will \\noriginally be set at a low height, at which competitors \\nmay choose to jump, or pass to another height. The \\nbar is raised to a predetermined height after each \\nround. Each competitor who either clears or passes \\na height advances to the next round.  They are \\nranked according to the height they clear. An athlete \\nis allowed a maximum of three trials of each height. \\nCompetitors are eliminated after missing (failing) three \\nconsecutive jumps in a particular height. Athletes \\nhave a short run up and then take off from near one \\nfoot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto \\na cushioned landing area. Jumping technique has \\nplayed a significant part in the history of the event. \\nThe modern technique of high jump as shown in the \\nfigure is known as “Fosbury Flop”.\\nFig. 4.13: High jump\\n 4.

The disc \\nis a round plate made of wood and metal and weighs \\n2 Kg for men and 1 Kg for women.  When throwing \\nthe discus, the athlete must remain in circle. The feet \\nof the athlete cannot leave this area before the discus \\nlands.  Even afterwards the athlete must leave the \\ncircle from rear half of the circle.

The athlete has to hold the javelin by its grip, \\nthrow the javelin overhand and cannot turn the back to \\nthe target when throwing. When throwing the javelin, \\nthe athlete runs down a runway to gain momentum and \\nthen must throw the javelin prior to crossing a line. The \\nathlete cannot go over the line until the javelin lands. To \\navoid foul, the athlete must have a really good balance at \\nthe end of the throw. The athlete must leave the runway \\nfrom behind the extended lines of the throwing arc.\\nFig. 4.18: Hammer throw\\n 4. Hammer Throw: The hammer throw doesn’t actually \\ninvolve throwing a hammer like you would think. \\nIn this throwing event the athletes throw a heavy \\nball (7.265 Kg for men and 4 Kg for women) that is \\nattached to a handle with a long (4 feet) wire.  Like the \\ndiscus and the shot put, the athlete must stay in a \\ncircle until the hammer lands. They spin several times \\nto gain momentum prior to releasing the hammer. \\nBalance is important due to the force generated by \\nhaving the heavy ball at the end of the long wire.\\nRules for field events\\nIn general, most field events allow an athlete to take their \\nattempt individually, under the same conditions as the \\nother athletes. Each attempt is measured to determine who \\nachieved the longest distance or maximum height.\\n • Horizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) must be \\ninitiated from behind a line. In the case of throws, that \\nline is an arc or inside a circle. Crossing the line while \\ninitiating the attempt will invalidate the attempt.

The players \\ntake positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that \\nis divided by a net. It is one of the few sports where men and \\nwomen can play together.  It is a game for all ages and abilities. \\nAlthough fitness is a key aspect for professional players, it is \\nalso played as a recreation game across the world.\\nHistory\\nThe origin of the badminton dates back to second century \\nBC. Although it appears that this sport was named after \\nBadminton House, Gloucestershire, owned by the Duke \\nof Beaufort. In 1873, some British army officers in India \\ninitially played the game at ‘Poonah’ (now known as Pune) \\nthus derived its name. In 1877 first set of rules were derived. \\nThese laws were gradually adopted by other nations. However, \\nthe game evolved as an international sport only after the \\nfirst All England Championship. In 1934, the International \\nBadminton Federation (now known as Badminton World \\nFederation) was formed and the rules of the game were \\nstandardized. Badminton Association of India came into \\nexistence in the year 1934.

Grip: Holding grip of a badminton racket is the \\nfoundation of playing this game. Holding the racket \\nwrongly will reduce the power and accuracy of the \\nstroke. The shots will be limited. A player needs to \\nlearn how to change grip quickly during games. Below \\nare the two basic types of badminton grips. \\nForehand grip\\n • This grip is used to hit shots on the forehand side of the \\nbody and around the head shots. \\n • In this a player holds the racket head in the non-playing \\nhand, keeping the handle points towards the body. The \\nface of the racket perpendicular to the floor. \\n • The player places the playing hand on the handle \\njust like shaking hands with it, it is like a V shape in \\nbetween thumb and index finger. \\n • For flexibility, the racket handle rest loosely in the fingers. \\n • In order to increase control and accuracy while serving \\nand hitting from the forecourt and mid court, the grip \\nis shortened and placed nearer to the shaft.\\nAngle 1\\nAngle 2 Angle 3\\nFig. 5.2: Forehand grip\\nChap-5.indd   55 8/24/2020   11:38:29 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Service: There are basically three types of serves —\\nhigh, low and flat. High service is the most basic of \\nall strokes. One needs to learn this first when one \\nstarts playing the game. You need to concentrate on \\nthe following three broad points while delivering the \\nhigh service.\\n • Stance: To deliver the high service, the player has \\nto take a position about two feet from the short \\nservice line and about six inches from the centre \\nline.\\n  The player has to make sure not to touch the \\ncentre line as it will be called a touch fault. The \\nplayer has to stand comfortably with both feet \\nspread apart and parallel to each other and take \\nthe initial serving position. At this stage, the full \\nweight of the body is on the back foot. \\n • Point of Contact: As one starts the forward \\nmovement of the racket, slowly start shifting the \\nweight from the back foot to the front foot. The \\nplayer then drops the shuttle and hit it high and \\nChap-5.indd   56 8/24/2020   11:38:34 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

The player must make sure \\nthat the point of contact is always below the waist.\\n • Follow-through: Once the service is delivered, the \\nplayer continues to swing the racket right across \\nthe left shoulder (or right shoulder if the player is \\nleft-handed). This is called the follow through. \\n 3. Return of Service: This stroke plays a crucial part in \\na rally because good return of serve allows a player to \\ndictate terms and control a rally till the point is won. \\nHowever weak return of serve will allow the opponent \\nto go on the offensive. While receiving the serve to hit \\nthe shuttle, normally players stand in the centre of the \\ncourt with the left foot forward and place the weight \\nof the body more on the front foot. It will help the \\nplayer to receive all types of serves i.e. high, low and \\nflick. In fact, players are advised to take the stance \\ncloser to the short service because in high serve the \\nshuttle remains in the air for a longer duration. On \\na high serve, a player has the choice of playing an \\nattacking clear, drop shot, smash or a half smash. \\nSimilarly, on a low serve, a player can flick, push or \\nlift the shuttle to the baseline. It is important to try \\nto meet the shuttle as close to the net as possible so \\nthat the receiver has more options available to choose  \\nthe shots. \\nGymnastics\\nGymnastics is a sport that involves physical movements \\nin a sequence. It requires physical strength, balance, \\ncoordination, endurance, flexibility and body control. It \\noften involves dance moves, flips, twists, jumps and other \\nmoves. It helps children to develop physical coordination and \\nmotor skills, proper use of balance develop a good sense of \\nprecision and timing. It can be performed as a way to stay fit \\nor specifically to compete in events locally, nationally as well \\nas internationally. \\nHistory\\nGymnastics was developed for fitness and beauty practices \\nby the ancient Greeks. It included skills for mounting \\nand dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills.  \\nThe Greeks used gymnastics as military training. However, \\nin the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the \\nGerman physical educators created exercises for boys \\nand young men on apparatus. Their design is considered \\nas modern gymnastics. The Federation of International \\nGymnastics was founded in 1881.

These are floor exercise, vaulting table, uneven \\nbars, and balancing beam. \\n 1. Events for men\\n (i) Floor Exercise: For this event a 12×12 square \\nspring floor is required. A series of tumbling \\npasses are performed to demonstrate flexibility, \\nstrength, and balance. The gymnast must also \\nshow strength skills, including circles, scales, and \\npress handstands.

The gymnast performs a \\nFig. 5.4: Pommel horse\\nFig. 5.5: Vault\\nroutine demonstrating balance, strength, power, \\nand dynamic motion while preventing the rings \\nthemselves from swinging. At least one static \\nstrength move is required, but some gymnast \\nincludes two or three strenghts. A routine should \\nhave a dismount at the end of routine.\\n (iv) Vault: In this, the gymnasts sprint down a runway, \\nwhich is a maximum of 25 meters in length, before \\nhurdling onto a spring board. The body position is \\nmaintained while “punching” (blocking using only a \\nshoulder movement) the vaulting board. The \\ngymnast then rotates to a standing position. Multiple \\ntwists and somersaults are added before landing in \\ncase of advance gymnastics. Vaults depend on the \\nspeed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power \\nthe gymnast generated from the legs and shoulder \\ngirdle and the kinesthetic awareness in the air. In \\ncase of more difficult and complex vaults the speed \\nof rotation is more important.\\n (v) Parallel Bars: Men perform \\non two bars. These are \\nkept slightly further than \\na shoulder’s width apart \\nand usually 1.75 m high. \\nFor executing a series \\nof swings, balances, \\nand releases require \\ngreat strength and co-\\nordination.\\n (vi) Horizontal Bar: A 2.8 cm thick steel or fiberglass \\nbar raised 2.5m above the landing area is all the \\ngymnasts have to hold onto as they perform giants \\n(revolutions around the bar), release skills, twists, \\nand changes of direction. By using all of the \\nmomentum from giants and then releasing at the \\nproper point, enough height can be achieved for \\nspectacular dismounts. Leather grips are usually \\nused to help maintain a grip on the bar.\\n 2. Events for women\\n (i) Floor Exercise: The floor event occurs on a carpeted \\n12m × 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam \\nover a layer of plywood, which is supported by \\nsprings or foam blocks generally called a “spring” \\nfloor.

Every gymnast starts at a different point \\non the vault runway depending on her height and \\nstrength. The post flight segment may include one \\nor more multiple somersaults, and/or twisting \\nmovements. In vaults with round-off entries, \\ngymnasts “round-off” so that hands are on the \\nrunway while the feet land on the springboard. \\nFrom the round-off position the gymnast travels \\nbackwards as in a back handspring so that the \\nhands land on the vaulting platform (horse).  \\nShe then blocks off the vaulting platform into \\nvarious twisting and somersaulting combinations.\\n (iii) Uneven Bars: On the uneven bars (also known as \\nasymmetric bars), the gymnast performs a routine \\non two horizontal bars set at different heights. The \\nheight is generally fixed, but the width may be \\nadjusted. Gymnasts perform swinging, circling, \\ntransitional, and release moves, as well as moves \\nthat pass through the handstand. Usually in higher \\nlevels of gymnastics, leather grips are worn to ensure \\nthat the gymnast maintains a grip on the bar, and \\nto protect the hands from blisters and tears. \\n (iv) Balance Beam: The gymnast performs a \\nchoreographed routine from 70 to 90 seconds \\nin length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills, \\nturns and dance elements on a padded spring \\nbeam. Apparatus norms set by the International \\nGymnastics Federation specify that the beam \\nmust be 125 cm (4’) high, 500 cm (16’) long, and \\n10 cm (4.5”) wide. The event requires in particular, \\nbalance, flexibility and strength. \\n 3. Rhythmic gymnastics\\n  Only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics, \\nalthough there is a new version of this discipline \\nfor men being pioneered in Japan. This combines \\nelements of ballet, gymnastics, dance and apparatus \\nmanipulation. The sport involves the performance of \\nfive separate routines with the use of five apparatus \\n– Ball, Ribbon, Hoop, Clubs, Rope on a floor area, \\nwith a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather \\nthan the acrobatic. \\nFig. 5.7: Uneven bars\\nFig. 5.8: Balance beam\\nChap-5.indd   60 8/24/2020   11:38:37 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Acrobatic gymnastics\\n  Acrobatic gymnastics is one of the oldest \\nforms of organised physical activities,  \\nand today it is being reorganised, revitalised by \\nchanges and renewed interest. The International \\nFederation of Sports Acrobatics (IFSA) was founded \\nin Moscow in 1973. United States Sports Acrobatics \\n(USSA) was founded in 1975.  It was merged with \\nInternational Gymnastics federation (FIG) in 1999. \\nSports Acrobatics was demonstration sports at the \\n2000 Olympics in Sydney. Now, it is an accepted \\ncompetitive sport. It is  very effective for the \\ndevelopment of physical fitness and graceful posture.\\n  Acrobatic gymnastics is a group gymnastic discipline \\nfor both men and women. Acrobats in groups of two, \\nthree and four perform routines with the heads, \\nhands and feet of their partners. They may, subject to \\nregulations (e.g. instrumental), pick their own music.\\n 5. Tumbling and trampolining\\n  Tumbling, also known as power tumbling, is a \\ngymnastics sporting discipline which combines skills \\nof artistic gymnastics with those of trampolining. It \\nis sometimes practiced on a 25-meter-long spring \\ntrack, competitors both male and female, perform two \\npasses, each containing eight skills, along the track.\\ntaBle tennis\\nTable Tennis is also known as Ping-Pong, in which two or \\nfour players participate using table-tennis rackets on a plain \\nhard surface called Table, which is divided by a net.\\nHistory\\nThe game of Table Tennis probably descended from the \\ngame of ‘Royal Tennis’, which was played in the medieval \\nera (12th century A.D.) Table Tennis was probably played \\nwith improvised equipment in England during the last \\nquarter of 19th century. Evidence show that David Foster \\nin England patented an action game of Tennis on Table in \\n1890. One year later John Jaques came out with a game \\ncalled Gossima. In 1900, a celluloid ball was introduced by \\nJaques and the name was given as ‘Ping-Pong’. Table Tennis \\nis controlled by ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation) \\nwhich was founded in 1926 with headquarters in Berlin. It \\nwas introduced in Olympics in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. \\nFirst World Championship of Table-Tennis was held in \\nLondon in 1926. TTFI (Table-Tennis Federation of India) was \\nformed in 1926 in Calcutta, now known as Kolkata.\\nChap-5.indd   61 8/24/2020   11:38:37 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Services: There are different kind, of services, such as, \\nlong service, short service, spin service, flat service, \\nhigh toss service and back-hand or forehand service. \\n 3. Types of strokes: The two types of strokes are offensive \\nand defensive including backhand and forehand.\\n (i) Offensive strokes (drive, loop drive, loop, loop kill, \\nhook, counter drive, flip and smash)\\n a) Drive: The racket is primarily perpendicular \\nto the direction of the stroke, and most of the \\nenergy applied to the ball results in speed \\nrather than spin, creating a shot that does \\nnot arc much, but it is fast enough to make it \\ndifficult to return.\\n b) Loop drive: The racket is much more parallel \\nto the direction of the stroke (closed) and the \\nracket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large \\namount of topspin. Variations in spin and \\nspeed add to the effectiveness of this shot. \\n c) Loop: The loop produces a more pronounced \\nloopy arc, with a higher trajectory and extreme \\ntopspin, but is typically slower.\\n d) Loop kill: The loop kill produces a flatter arc, \\nwith higher speed that resembles a speed \\ndrive but with stronger topspin.\\n e) Hook: It is similar  to a regular Loop, but carries \\na tilted topspin (or is referred as the “top-side” \\nspin), it bounces sideways and downward \\nupon hitting the table. \\n f) Counter drive: It is a counter attack against \\ndrives (normally high loop drives).

The racket is \\nheld closed and near to the ball, which is hit \\nwith a short movement off the bounce (before \\nreaching the highest point) so that the ball \\ntravels faster to the other side.\\n g) Flip: When a player tries to attack a ball that \\nhas not bounced beyond the edge of the table, \\nhowever the ball may still be attacked, and the \\nresulting shot is called flip because the back \\nswing is compressed into a quick wrist action. \\n h) Smash: Smash is executed when his or her \\nopponent has returned a ball that bounces too \\nhigh and/ or too close to the net. Smashing \\nis a large back swing and rapid acceleration \\nimparting as much speed on the ball as possible. \\n (ii) Defensive strokes\\n a) Push or Slice: The push is usually used for \\nkeeping the point alive and creating offensive \\nopportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice, \\nthe racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting \\nbackspin and causing the ball to float slowly \\nto the other side of the table. Offensive players \\nshould only push for variation and not for \\ngeneral rallies. \\n b) Chop: A chop or cut is the defensive, backspin \\ncounterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop \\nis essentially a bigger, heavier slice, taken well \\nback from the table. Sometimes a defensive \\nplayer can impart no spin on the ball during \\na chop, or frequently add right- or left-hand \\nspin to the ball. This may further confuse his/\\nher opponent. \\n c) Block: A block is executed by simply putting \\nthe racket in front of the ball, the ball rebounds \\nback toward the opponent with nearly as \\nmuch energy as it came in with. This is not \\nas easy as it sounds, because the ball’s spin, \\nspeed, and location, all influence the correct \\nangle of a block. \\n d) Side spin drive: The premise of this move is to \\nput a spin on the ball either to the right or the \\nleft of the racket. The execution of this move \\nis similar to a slice, but to the right or left, \\ninstead of down. This spin will result in the ball \\ncurving to the side but bouncing in the opposite \\ndirection when the opponent returns it. \\nChap-5.indd   64 8/24/2020   11:38:38 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

To execute a High \\nBall, a defensive player first backs off the table \\n8-10 meters; then, the stroke itself consists of \\nsimply lifting the ball to an enormous height \\nbefore it falls back to the opponent’s side of \\nthe table. A High Ball is inherently a creative \\nshot, and can have nearly any kind of spin.\\n f) Drop shot: The drop shot is a high level stroke, \\nused as another variation for close-to-table \\nstrokes. The player has position the racket close \\nto the ball and just let the ball touch it (without \\nany hand movement) in a way that the ball stays \\nclose to the net with almost no speed and spin, \\nand touches the other side of the table more \\nthan twice if the opponent doesn’t reach it. \\nSkills\\nForehand drive\\n • Keep arm close to the torso.\\n • Forearm makes 90° with the upper arm.\\n • Draw the forearm back to another 45°.\\n • Let the waist turn naturally along with the arm and \\nshift your weight towards the right foot.\\n • Swing forward with a slight upward motion while \\nshifting your weight back to left foot.\\n • Elbow should be used as a pivot point and should only \\nmove a little forward in the follow through.\\nFig. 5.11: Forehand drive\\nBackhand drive\\n • Form ready position.\\n • Turn waist towards left with Racket towards 9 O’clock \\nposition.\\n • Contact with the ball is made in front of the body \\nslightly after the top of the bounce.\\nChap-5.indd   65 8/24/2020   11:38:42 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Equipment\\n (i) Racquets: Tennis racquet must adhere to the \\nfollowing guidelines — \\n • The hitting area, composed of the strings, \\nmust be flat and generally uniform.\\n • The frame of the hitting area may not be more \\nthan 29 inches in length and 12.5 inches in \\nwidth.\\n • The entire racquet must be of a fixed shape, \\nsize, weight, and weight distribution. There \\nmay not be any energy source built into the \\nracquet.\\n • The racquet must not provide any kind of \\ncommunication, instruction or advice to the \\nplayer during the match.\\n (ii) Balls: Tennis balls are of hollow rubber with a \\nfelt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant \\ncolour was gradually changed to optic yellow in \\nthe latter part of the 20th century to ensure better \\nvisibility.\\n (iii) Court\\n • Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface, \\nusually grass or clay, a hard court of concrete \\nand/or asphalt and occasionally carpet \\n(indoor). The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, \\nand 27 feet (8.23 m) wide for singles matches \\nand 36 ft (10.97 m) for doubles’ matches. \\n • Additional clear space around the court is \\nrequired for players so as to reach over run \\nballs. \\n • A net is stretched across the full width of the \\ncourt, parallel with the baselines, dividing it \\ninto two equal ends. The net is 3 feet 6 inches \\n(1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (91.4 cm) \\nhigh in the center. \\n (iv) Lines\\n • The lines that delineate the width of the court \\nare called the baseline (farthest back) and the \\nservice line (middle of the court). \\n • The short mark in the center of each baseline \\nis referred to as either the hash mark or the \\ncenter mark. \\nChap-5.indd   68 8/24/2020   11:38:49 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

These are \\nthe boundaries used when doubles is being \\nplayed. \\n • The lines to the inside of the doubles’ \\nsidelines are the singles’ sidelines and used as \\nboundaries in singles’ play. The area between \\na doubles’ sideline and the nearest singles’ \\nsideline is called the doubles’ alley, which is \\nconsidered playable in doubles’ play. \\n • The line that runs across the center of a \\nplayer’s side of the court is called the service \\nline because the serve must be delivered into \\nthe area between the service line and the net \\non the receiving side. \\n • All the lines are required to be 2 inches  \\n(51 mm) in width. The baseline can be up to 4 \\ninches (100 mm) wide if so desired. \\n (v) Scoring\\n • The players (or teams) start on opposite sides \\nof the net. One player is designated as the \\nserver, and the opposing player is the receiver. \\n • A tennis match is determined through the \\nbest of 3 or 5 sets. Women play 3 set matches, \\nwhile men play 5 set matches. For men, the \\nfirst player to win three sets wins the match, \\nand for women, the first player to win two sets \\nwins the match.\\n • A set consists of games, and a game, in turn, \\nconsists of a sequence of points played with \\nthe same player serving. \\n • A game is won by the first player to have won \\nat least four points in total and at least two \\npoints more than the opponent. \\n • The running score of each game is described \\nin a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from \\nzero to three points are described as “love”, \\n“15”, “30”, and “40” respectively \\n • If at least three points have been scored by \\neach player, making the player’s score equal \\nat 40 a piece, the score is not called out as \\n“40-40”, but rather as “deuce”. \\n • If at least three points have been scored by \\neach side and a player has one more point \\nthan the opponent, the score of the game is \\n“advantage” for the player in the lead. \\nChap-5.indd   69 8/24/2020   11:38:49 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Break points are of particular \\nimportance because serving is generally \\nconsidered advantageous, with the server being \\nexpected to win games in which they are serving. \\n • A receiver who has one (score of 30–40), two \\n(score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) \\nconsecutive chances to win the game has \\nbreak point, double break point or triple break \\npoint, respectively.\\n • If the leading player wins that game, the player \\nwins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins \\nthe game, a tie-break is played. A tie-break, \\nplayed under a separate set of rules, allows \\none player to win one more game and thus the \\nset, to give a final set score of 7–6. \\n • In tournament play, the chair umpire \\nannounces the winner of the set and the \\noverall score.\\n 2. Grip\\n  A grip is a way of holding the racquet in order to hit \\nshots during a match. There are three types of grip. \\n i.  Forehand: the tennis forehand is a stroke in \\nwhich the inner side of the palm of the dominant \\nhand that is holding the racket faces forward. The \\nforehand stroke is made by swinging the racket \\nacross one’s body in the direction of where one \\nwants to land the ball.\\n ii. Backhand: The backhand is a tennis stroke in \\nwhich one swings the racquet around one’s body \\nwith the back of the hand preceding the palm.\\n iii. The Serve (Service): A serve in tennis is a shot to \\nstart a pint. A player will hit the ball with racquet \\nso it will fall into the diagonally opposite service \\nbox without being stopped by the net. There are \\nthree types of serve —\\n a) Flat Serve \\n b) Slice Serve\\n c) Kick Serve\\nChap-5.indd   70 8/24/2020   11:38:49 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

The swimmers try \\nto use a technique that is quicker and gives a strong push \\noff from the wall within the permissible rules of the stroke. \\nThe various turns used by swimmers are: (i) Simple turn  \\n(ii) Throw away turn (iii) Summer Sault turn (iv) Flip turn (v) \\nRoll over turn (vi) Breast stroke turn (vii) Butterfly turn. \\nThe following sequence is followed in the turn: (i) Approach \\nto the wall (ii) Turn or touch (iii) Push off (iv) Glide (v) First \\nstroke.\\nTactics\\nSwimming is an individual and cyclic sport. It is highly \\ncompetitive with the application of science. It is getting \\ntransformed from an art to science. Now, the importance is \\ngiven to strategy and tactics for completing and pacing the \\nrace. In order to achieve the best performance, a swimmer \\nmust learn to distribute the distance economically and \\nthoughtfully throughout the race. Tactics in swimming \\nduring different races can be categorised in three different \\nphase —  (i) Sprint races (ii) Middle distance races (iii) Long \\ndistance races\\nSprint races\\nThe 50 m race or the sprint race depends on the start, \\nmaintaining the speed and a good finish.\\nMiddle and Long distance races\\nIn these races, the key word is to build endurance and speed. \\nIn middle and long distance races, the swimmer tries to \\nprevent building up high oxygen debt. Swimming at a very \\nfast pace will accumulate a high level of oxygen debt early \\nin the race and will experience an immediate drop in speed. \\nSwimmer may sometimes prefer to begin faster than an ideal \\npace and attempt to get out in front avoiding the choppy \\nwaters. Some swimmers like to swim the strategy races in \\nrelation to the opponent.\\nChap-5.indd   73 8/24/2020   11:38:50 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

In some areas, people have access to facilities, such \\nas, water supply, sanitation, garbage disposal facilities, health \\ncare services, recreational facilities, community centre, schools, \\ntransportation, etc., but in some places people do not have access to \\neven the most basic amenities. \\nA community is said to be healthy when its members \\ncontinuously work together to maintain, improve and expand \\nthe available natural resources and avoid their wastage.  \\nThe healthy community only be develped when its members \\nrecognise their roles and responsibilities.

Healthy \\ncommunity is one in which all residents have access to \\nquality education, safe and healthy homes, adequate \\nemployment, transportation, physical activity and \\nnutrition. Living in overcrowded and unhygienic places \\nwith excessive noise and pollution, may lead to various \\nforms of illnesses, diseases and stress. For instance, lack \\nof adequate space, poor ventilation in rooms and toxic \\nfumes in the air, increase the risk of air borne diseases. \\nAccess to basic amenities such as regular water supply, \\nsafe drinking water and sanitation, is important for \\nhealthy community living. In the previous classes (Classes \\nVII to IX), it has been learnt that open and unattended \\ngarbage dumps are a potential breeding place for flies, \\ncockroaches, insects and so on. Stagnant water and open \\ndrains breed mosquitoes, the carrier of diseases, such as, \\nmalaria, dengue and chikungunya. Water borne diseases, \\nsuch as, cholera, jaundice, diarrhea and gastroenteritis \\nare also resulted due to water pollution.\\nAccess to basic amenities also includes other provisions \\nsuch as electricity, hospitals, dispensaries, housing facilities, \\nroads and transportation, schools, colleges, employment, \\nsecurity, recreational facilities and so on.

At the physiological level, there may be \\nchanges in heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, secretions \\nof hormones, etc. At the psychological level, there may be \\nchanges in attention, concentration, memory and alertness \\nand also in the emotional state (like anger, fear, hate, \\nsadness, etc.).\\nStress generally occurs as a result of major events in \\nlife, such as, tough competitions, getting low scores in an \\nexamination, recent break-up in friendship, not getting a good \\njob, a fight with others, and so on. There are several  other \\nfactors which may cause stress in a person, like, diseases, \\npoor living conditions, poverty, problems in relationship, \\nchallenges of adolescence, wrong habits, high aspirations, \\nunrealistic goals, death of a close relative, discrimination, \\nfast changing life and many others.

A situation may be easy to handle for one person, \\nwhile it may pose a big challenge to another. For example, \\nexamination may cause stress in one student, while it may \\nnot affect another student. \\nStress which motivates us to perform better and learn new \\nskills is beneficial. For example, getting admission in a new \\ncourse, preparing for an examination or getting promotion \\nmay cause stress but this stress is beneficial as it finally \\ncontributes towards growth and development.

However, yoga is not \\nlimited to the physical postures, breathing techniques or \\nmeditation for a few minutes only. Rather yoga is a way of \\nlife also. It propounds several principles and practices, such \\nas, asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra, bandha and meditation \\nwhich are relevant to healthy living. Yogic principles and \\npractices of healthy living can be adopted by all, irrespective \\nof age, gender, profession or place.

Regarding quantity of food, mitahara  \\nmentions that two quarters of the stomach should be \\nfilled with food, one quarter with liquid and the remaining \\nquarter (one‑fourth) should be left empty for free flow of air. \\nThis implies that quantity of food may vary from person to \\nperson depending upon the individual requirements.

Adolescents (10–19 years) constitute over one-fifth of \\nthe total population, and their number is estimated to be about \\n243 million. They represent a resource for the future whose \\npotential needs to be nurtured in a positive \\nmanner. The adolescents are considered to \\nbe healthy as a group; however, they do have \\na range of health problems that cause a lot \\nof morbidity as well as mortality. In spite of \\nspecific health problems, it is  a common \\nobservation that the existing health services \\ndo not cater to the specific problems of \\nadolescents. Moreover, it is a challenge for \\nthe health sector to respond to their needs \\nadequately by offering services in a friendly \\nmanner in a non-threatening environment. \\nIn this chapter, an attempt has been made \\nto discuss the health needs of adolescents, \\nthe status of existing adolescent friendly \\nhealth services and the manner in which \\nthese services can be made available to \\nadolescents so that these can be adequately \\nutilised by them. \\n14.2 HealtH needs of adolescents\\nAs you have realised while going through the chapters ‘Growing \\nup with Confidence’ and ‘Diet for Healthy Living’, adolescence \\nis the most significant period in the life of human beings. \\nIt is imperative, therefore, that the needs of adolescents be \\nrecognised and met  adequately. Their health needs are \\nmentioned below.\\n (i) Nutritional Needs:  as discussed in the previous \\nchapters, many boys and girls enter adolescence \\nundernourished, making them more vulnerable to \\ndiseases. The findings of the National Family Health \\nSurvey 3 (NFHS 3) indicate high percentage of anaemia \\n(56 per cent of females and 25 per cent of males in  \\n15–24 age group were anaemic).

Anaemic women are \\nmore prone to give birth to malnourished children, with \\nsignificant morbidity and mortality associated with both \\nmother and child. Adequate nutrition and healthy eating \\nhabits and physical exercise at this age are foundations \\nfor good health in adulthood.\\n (ii) Reproductive and Sexual Health Needs: the adolescents \\nconfront a number of reproductive \\nand sexual health \\nproblems. They hesitate to seek information from \\nauthentic sources as such issues are considered taboo \\nin our society. There is always a possibility of their \\npractising risky behaviour, thereby acquiring HIV and \\nother sexually transmitted infections. According to \\nNational AIDS Control Organisation, almost 50 per cent \\nof new HIV infections are taking place in 15–24 years \\nage group (NACO 2005). The adolescent girls suffer due \\nto a number of myths related to menstruation. Early \\nmarriage is still a serious problem in many parts of \\nthe country. A substantial number of adolescent girls, \\nmostly married girls, become pregnant and give birth \\nto children below the legal age of marriage which is 18 \\nyears. According to NFHS 3, twelve per cent of married \\nyoung women aged 15–19 have become mothers and 4 \\nper cent of women ages 15–19 are currently pregnant \\nwith their first child. This means that one in six women \\nin the age group.  15–19 years begun child bearing. This \\nphenomenon of early pregnancy adversely affects the \\nhealth of both mothers and children and is the cause of \\nmortality and morbidity among them. \\n      Sexual harassment in public places, institutions  \\n  of education, in and around neighbourhood \\nand at the  \\n  workplace is a well established fact.  Child abuse,  \\n  bullying and ragging are also common, more so among  \\n  boys.  \\n (iii) Mental Health Concerns: it is estimated that at least \\n20 per cent of youth experience some form of mental \\nproblems such as \\ndepression, mood disturbances, \\nsubstance abuse, suicidal behaviour, eating disorders, \\naggression, violence. Among 15–19 year olds, suicide is \\nthe second leading cause of death, followed by violence \\nin the family and community. In fact, effective and \\nsensitive care of adolescent victims of violence is needed \\nas one of the priority measures. \\n (iv) Substance Abuse: tobacco and alcohol use among \\nyoung people is emerging as a matter of concern.

Injury rates among adolescents \\nare the highest. Public education targeted \\nat young people on how to avoid accidental \\ninjuries during driving and using road, \\ndrowning, burns and falls can reduce \\ninjuries.\\n In order to address the above needs, \\nadolescent friendly health services have \\nbeen developed. These adolescent friendly \\nhealth services have been designed \\nspecifically to attract them, meet \\ntheir \\nneeds conveniently and retain them for \\ncontinuing care. We have to take note of an \\nimportant fact that adolescents are not a \\nhomogeneous group.

They have a specialised approach for \\ngiving adolescents preventive, promotive and curative health \\ncare. These services are mostly run by the government and \\nin them diagnostic, treatment, counselling and other facilities \\nrelated to health are offered for free or at a very minimal charge. \\n14.4 need for afHs\\nSpecialised services are needed for adolescents because they \\nare still in the developmental stage.

Health is the general condition \\nof a person in respect to all aspects of life. It is also a level \\nof functional and/or metabolic efficiency of an organism. The \\nword metabolic is the adjective of the term metabolism which \\nmeans the whole range of big chemical processes that occur \\nwithin us or any living organism to produce energy and basic \\nmaterials needed for important life processes. Diseases and \\nillness adversely affect these processes. And thus health, \\ndiseases and illness are inter-related. However,   health is not \\njust being free from diseases, illness or injury.  As defined \\nby World Health Organisation (WHO), health is “a state of \\ncomplete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely \\nan absence of disease or infirmity”. \\n1.2  What Is Illness?\\nLet’s now see how is illness different from that of disease? \\nWhile illness and disease are at times used interchangeably, \\nthese in fact, are different from each other. Disease refers to a \\nbiomedically defined deviation from norms of body function or \\nstructure, whereas, illness is the experience of this deviation. \\nIt is a state of experience by the body when one or more of \\nthe control systems of the body are not functioning normally. \\nIllness refers to a subjective distress  feeling of a person, when \\none is sick or suffering from some disease.  However, it is not \\nappropriate to conclude that any one being merely free from \\nillness or disease is healthy.\\nYou might have seen people suffering from various types of \\ndiseases. Some of the diseases, like high blood pressure affect \\nonly a particular person who is suffering from it. On the other \\nhand, some diseases like common cold, spread rapidly and \\naffect a number of people in a very short period. You must \\nhave often wondered as to how does this happen. In one of the \\nchapters of your textbook on Science, you would have studied \\nabout ‘Why We Fall Ill’. In that chapter, it is mentioned how \\ndiseases are caused and how some of these affect only the \\npersons who suffer from them are called non-communicable, \\nwhereas, there are those diseases that are transmitted from one \\n2024-25'),\n",

The chapter \\nalso mentions how communicable and non-communicable \\ndiseases can be prevented and controlled. \\n1.3  c ommunIcable dIseases \\nLet us understand how communicable diseases are spread. These \\ndiseases are caused by certain infectious agents which may be \\nbacteria or viruses. These are capable of being transmitted from \\nperson to person or from the environment to person.\\n1.3.1\\n Classification  \\nCommunicable diseases can be classified on \\nthe basis of the \\ncausative organisms. These are as follow:\\n•\\t Bacterial: Typhoid, Cholera, Tuberculosis\\n•\\t Viral: Common cold, Influenza, HIV infection, Dengue\\n•\\t Protozoal: Malaria, Kala azar\\n•\\t Fungal: Fungal infections of nails, groins, skin, hair\\n•\\t Parasitic: Infestations of intestinal worms, like round  \\nworm, or lice.\\nModes of transmission: The modes of transmission can be \\nclassified as direct and indirect transmission. \\n(a) Direct transmission\\nAs we have studied in our earlier classes, direct transmission \\nof diseases takes place as follows:\\nDirect contact or touching: When we touch a person or \\ncome in direct contact with the skin or mucous membrane of \\nthe diseased person, it transmits infections like skin and eye \\ninfection.\\nDroplet infection:  Spray of droplets of saliva or secretion \\nof a diseased person spreads common cold, tuberculosis, \\nmeningitis.\\nContact with soil: Can cause acquiring the disease agent \\ndirectly and may spread diseases like: hookworm infestation \\nand tetanus.\\nInoculation into skin or mucosa: Certain diseases \\nspread in other ways. For example, Rabies is spread to \\nhumans from animal. It is generally known that it occurs due \\nto a dog or a monkey bite. Hepatitis occurs owing to virus, \\ntransmitted through contaminated needles. The HIV (Human \\nImmunodeficiency Virus) can be transmitted by sexual contact \\nor through transmission of infected blood from an infected \\nperson. HIV can be transmitted by the HIV infected mother \\nto baby and can cause AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency \\nSyndrome).\\nactIvIty 1.1\\nDiscuss with your \\nclassmates, why \\nwe should not go to \\npublic places when \\nsuffering from cold, \\ncough or fever?\\nChapter-1 Health & diseases.indd   2 08-11-2016   11:04:47 AM\\n2024-25'),\n",

For example, typhoid, diarrhoea, \\npolio, intestinal parasites and infective hepatitis. Flies \\ncontaminate food and other eatables.\\nA living carrier (also known as a vector) is a disease \\nagent that lives on or inside the body of the carrier causing \\ndiseases like malaria and plague. Airborne infectious materials \\ntransmitted through droplet infection or dust cause diseases \\nlike respiratory infections and itch mites. Fomites are objects \\nlike towels, handkerchiefs, toys, glass, spoons, etc. which we \\nuse daily. Eye and skin infections and dysentery (diarrhoea \\nwith blood) are spread through these fomites. Our unclean \\nhands and fingers act as disease causing agents and transfer \\ninfection to food through skin, nose, and causes diseases, such \\nas intestinal parasites, dysentery, typhoid. \\nHealthy people can also spread disease if they are “carriers”.  \\nThese are the people who themselves may be immune to the \\norganisms they harbour, but can be a source of transmission \\nto others as happens in the case of typhoid.  \\n1.3.2\\n Prevention  and  Control  of  Communicable Diseases\\nThe following measures help in prevention and control the \\nspread of communicable diseases:\\nPersonal hygiene\\n•\\t Bathing everyday and clean clothes keep \\nour body free \\nfrom harmful microbes.\\n•\\t Cutting nails and washing hair regularly.\\n•\\t Brushing teeth twice a day (morning and night) \\nparticularly after meals. \\n•\\t Ensuring that your ears are clean. \\n•\\t Do not share articles that are of personal use, that is, \\ntowels, soaps, tooth brushes, combs, razors and other \\ntoiletries. \\n•\\t Wash hands before touching food or water and before \\neating or drinking.\\n•\\t Wash hands with soap and water before touching your \\nface, eyes and mouth and also before and after using \\nthe toilet. \\n•\\t Many microbes like virus, bacteria and fungi are \\ntransmitted by touching surfaces with hands and \\nactIvIty 1.2\\n•\\t List how many \\nthings you follow \\nfor food and \\nwater hygiene \\n•\\t Discuss the list \\nwith your friend.\\n•\\t What would \\nyou like to do \\nto improve your \\npersonal hygiene.\\nChapter-1 Health & diseases.indd   3 08-11-2016   11:04:47 AM\\n2024-25'),\n",

You will study more about the structure and \\nfunctions of the reproductive system in your science classes. \\nIn this chapter you will learn about the need to keep it healthy. \\nIn fact, reproductive health refers to healthy reproductive \\norgans performing normal functions. But there are diseases \\nthat adversely affect this system. These are as follows: \\n1.5.1 Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and Sexually  \\nTransmitted Infections (STIs) \\nReproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and Sexually Transmitted \\nInfections (STIs) are non-communicable diseases which \\naffect the quality of life and have important bearing on \\nthe reproductive functions. RTIs are infections involving \\nreproductive organs. These can be caused by various microbes \\nlike bacteria, viruses or protozoa.  Improper maintenance of \\nhygiene of the genital organs or through infected instruments \\nused in medical procedures for treating genital organs also \\nresult in reproductive tract infections. \\nSTIs are infections which are transmitted through close \\nphysical and sexual contact between individuals. However, \\nSTIs like infections through Human Immunodeficiency Virus \\n(HIV) and hepatitis B and C can also spread by non-sexual \\nmodes like sharing of needles, transfusion of infected blood \\nand using infected equipment for surgery.\\nbox 1.3\\nDo You Know?\\n•\\t One should not \\nadminister self \\nmedication.\\n•\\t We must always \\nconsult the doctor \\nbefore taking any \\nmedication.\\nChapter-1 Health & diseases.indd   9 08-11-2016   11:04:48 AM\\n2024-25'),\n",

Adolescents grow at a \\nfast pace and are active, so they need extra nourishment. \\nBut their food preferences are often influenced by friends \\nand media rather than nutritional requirement. They need \\nguidance in this regard. Nutritious food preparations can \\nbe planned in the form they enjoy, like spinach paratha or \\nspinach, carrot and potato soup instead of spinach vegetable. \\nElders often have difficulty in chewing, swallowing and \\ndigestion; they need soft and easily digestible foods, such as, \\nwell cooked vegetables, idli etc.  \\nGender\\nNutritional requirements vary with gender. Till the age of 10 \\nyears nutritional requirements are same, thereafter both grow \\nat different pace and their body composition is also different. \\nMostly men are taller and heavier than women. They are more \\nmuscular while women have more fat cells. Thus, their body \\ntypes are different leading to different nutrient requirements. \\nFemales need more iron (hemoglobin) due to blood loss during \\nmenstruation. Lack of iron often puts them at high risk of \\niron deficiency or anemia. Whole grains, seasonal fruits, \\ngreen leafy vegetables and dairy products are healthy for both \\ngenders. Food preferences may also vary with gender. \\nPhysical activity\\nEnergy and nutrient requirements vary with physical \\nactivity. Sitting jobs like reading, computer work, etc., need \\nless energy and heavy duty tasks like cycling, carrying heavy \\nload, sports, etc., need more energy. Intensity and duration \\nof activity also affect the requirements, e.g., a person cycling \\nnormally needs lesser energy than a person participating in \\na race, need nutrients, like vitamin B, in accordance with \\nenergy requirement. In general energy from fried foods, extra \\nbutter or ghee needs to be avoided. Food preparations from \\nwhole foods, nuts, oilseeds, dairy foods, egg, and fish can \\nfulfill the requirement for energy and other nutrients. \\nPhysiological state\\nPhysiological conditions like infancy, childhood, adolescence, \\npregnancy, lactation impose high demands of food and \\nnutrients due to higher rate of growth and development. \\nFor example, a healthy sedentary woman needs  \\n1900 kcal/day while the same woman, if pregnant, will need \\n2200 kcal.

The fifth taste is referred to as \\numami which is similar to the taste of monosodium glutamate (MSG). \\nAyurveda describes six tastes namely, sweet, salt, bitter, \\nsour, pungent and astringent which can easily be linked with the \\ntastes of sugar, salt, neem, lemon, chilli and amla respectively. \\nFlavour is sensed by both nose and tongue together.

While planning meals, it is \\nimportant to take care that it keeps one satisfied for sufficient \\ntime and does not lead to hunger pangs soon. This in turn will \\naffect the working capacity, efficiency and health of a person. \\nMedia and advertisement \\nMany persons, particularly children, choose food tempted by \\nadvertisements. Further they choose a certain food because \\nit is available on discount or as a free gift. Such practice is \\ncommon with some processed, packaged and ready to eat \\nfoods. These items may initially attract, appear cheap but on \\nregular use they may turn out to be costly, less nutritious \\nand unhealthy. Hence it is necessary to see nutrition facts \\non the label of the packing to make healthy food choices. \\nUsing the same concept to advertise nutritious foods will \\nencourage people to choose and consume healthy diets. \\nAccessibility and transport \\nFoods available nearby are usually selected. It commonly \\nhappens with people living in remote areas, elders, handicaps \\nand persons not having requisite transport facilities. Famines, \\ndroughts, heavy rainfall, cyclones and road blockages further \\nlimit the food supply. Big bazaars, home delivery system and \\nonline purchase have improved the access to food.

Besides age, gender, body composition, \\ntypes of sports, intensity and duration of the event, the \\nenvironmental factors also greatly affect their nutritional \\nrequirements. Adequate nutrition is of utmost importance for \\ntheir health, physical fitness, endurance, peak performance \\nand prevention of dehydration, injury and infection. The \\nright kind of food given at the right time in right proportion \\nis of paramount importance for sportpersons to prolong their \\nsporting life. \\nCarbohydrates\\nCarbohydrates are major sources of energy for sportpersons. \\nFor general fitness, 3-5 g carbohydrate per Kg body weight per \\nday is sufficient. For intensive sport like football, gymnastic, \\nweight lifting, 5-10 g carbohydrate per Kg body weight per \\nday may be required. Body stores of carbohydrate (glycogen) \\nmust be sufficient before and during exercise. Glycogen \\nstores determine the stamina and performance. For one \\nhour of exercise, no extra intake except water is needed. \\nCarbohydrate requirement increases with increasing duration \\nof workout. Timing of carbohydrates intake is vital.  Intake \\nof high carbohydrate, easily digestible food, 2-4 hours before \\ntraining and event are advisable for quick energy release \\nand replenishment in the body. Food preparations having \\npotato (baked), bread, rice, semolina (suji), and banana \\nalong with liquid food are suggested. Excessive consumption \\nof carbohydrates may lead to weight gain, cause digestive \\ndiscomfort, muscle stiffness, diarrhea, lethargy, etc., and \\neventually hamper the performance.\\nProtein \\nDepending upon the intensity of the sport, protein requirement \\ncan range from 1.2 -2.0g per kg body weight per day. Sufficient \\nintake of carbohydrates ensures that protein is used for \\nbuilding and repairing of muscles and tissues; for formation \\nof hormones, enzymes, antibodies and neurotransmitters; \\npreventing damage; and not for giving energy. For better \\nutilisation of protein, consume carbohydrate and protein \\nfood sources in appropriate proportion, preferably 3:1 or 4:1 \\nfor better performance in endurance events.\\nFoods like egg, whey protein, soy and milk (casein), \\nlow fat dairy products, grains, nuts, seeds and beans \\nprovide good quality protein. Readymade protein powders \\nshould be avoided or taken under expert supervision only.  \\nLow protein intake makes sportpersons susceptible to fatigue, \\nActivity 9.3\\n • Make a diet plan \\nfor your team \\nparticipating in football \\nin Meghalaya, giving \\nsuitable justifications.\\n • Your physical \\neducation teacher \\nmust be planning \\nevents for sports day. \\nNote down the diets \\nhe or she suggests to \\nyou.

Foods \\nrich in omega-3 fatty acids like flax seeds, fish oil, salmon, \\nconsumed in the right amount, enhance strength and vigour \\nin the body and accelerate performance. However, high intake \\nof fat eventually leads to overweight, obesity and associated \\nhealth problems which hamper performance significantly.\\nVitamins and minerals \\nVitamins and minerals are crucial in sport because energy \\nutilisation in the body is largely associated with them, \\nparticularly some group B vitamins and magnesium. Folate, \\ncalcium, zinc, iron are other crucial micronutrients which \\nget depleted faster during long exercises. Vitamin C plays \\nan important role in collagen synthesis and absorption and \\nutilisation of iron in the body. Vitamin B6 helps in protein \\nutilisation. Vitamin A, E and C are important to prevent cell \\ndamage and act as antioxidants which are needed to reduce \\nstress and improve stamina and immunity.

It ensures the availability of \\nwholesome food that is safe for consumption. Amendment and \\nup-gradation are done from time to time. FSSAI code is given \\nto each food item which you can see on various food products.\\nPhysical examination of food is done on the basis of size, \\nshape, color, texture and visual appeal. The food should be \\nfree from dirt, cracks or any foreign material; contamination \\nby bacteria, mould, virus, yeast; and infestation by insects, \\npests, rats, mice, flies and cockroaches which lead to food \\nspoilage and make the food unfit for human consumption. \\nFood quality can seriously be influenced by factors like heat \\n(temperature); air (oxygen, humidity) or moisture content \\nof food, type of food itself and its composition, treatment \\ngiven to food during processing, handling and storage.  \\nFood quality is favorably altered by techniques of food \\npreservation.

It is a serious threat to food quality and can \\nbe fatal. It is mainly caused by microorganisms, over activity \\nof some enzymes and insects, pests and rodents. High \\nmoisture content, temperature and nutrient composition of \\nfood affects the growth of causative factors and accelerate \\nfood spoilage. The knowledge of approximate shelf life of \\ndifferent foods helps in reducing spoilage. The duration of \\ntime during which the food item remains fit for consumption \\nat room temperature is called shelf life which determines \\nperishability. Thus, foods are — \\n 1. Perishable which remain fresh and edible for few \\nhours to 1-2 days only, e.g., milk, meat, green leafy \\nvegetables. \\n 2. Semi-perishable which remain fresh and edible for \\nabout a week (5-7 days) e.g., some vegetables and \\nfruits.\\n 3. Non-perishable which remain fresh and edible for \\nmore than a month, e.g., grains, sugar, oil, pulses.\\nFood is precious and is not available in unlimited quantity. \\nSo food should not be wasted rather protected from spoilage. \\nProper storage of food decreases food spoilage and various \\nFig. 9.5: ISI\\nActivity 9.5\\n • Collect five perishable \\nfood items and \\nleave them at room \\ntemperature.

The techniques are — \\n 1. Heat treatment: Application of  heat helps in preserving \\nfood by destroying the harmful microorganisms. For \\nexample, Pasteurisation of milk and sterilisation of \\nbottles. \\n 2. Refrigeration and freezing: Low temperature limit \\nthe enzymatic and microbial activities keeping the \\nfood safe for longer duration. \\n 3. Drying or dehydration: This technique is based on \\nreducing or removing the moisture content of food as \\nmicrobes cannot grow in the absence of water. \\n 4. Addition of preservatives: Preservatives are natural \\nor chemical ingredients which selectively control \\nthe growth of microorganisms and enzymes in food \\nand restrict spoilage. Jams and jellies are preserved \\nby sugar and pickles by salt, spices and oil. Acid \\nmedium also restrict the growth of bacteria. Chemical \\npreservatives like sodium benzoate or Potassium Meta \\nbisulphite (KMS) are used in ketchups and squashes. \\nPreservatives are used in very small quantity. Use \\nabove the prescribed limit is harmful and punishable \\nunder law.\\n 5. Preservation by Radiation: Radiations are emissions \\nof intense energy capable of penetrating tissues. When \\nfood is exposed to specific form of radiation (gamma \\nrays from Cobalt 60) under controlled conditions it \\nincreases their shelf life and is referred as irradiated \\nfood. Items like fruits, potatoes, onions, spices, herbs \\nand some ready-to-eat foods can be preserved in this \\nway. But this technique is not suitable for milk and \\nmilk products. The safety of irradiated foods is under \\ndebate. Consumers can choose or avoid irradiated \\nfoods by identifying its symbol on the label.

Chemical \\npesticides have played a significant role in increasing food \\nproduction, but unnecessary and excessive use of these \\nover a long period of time has adversely influenced various \\nforms of life on earth, as well as, the quality of soil, water \\nand environment. These have disrupted the natural balance \\nof the ecosystem. \\nPesticides often leave their residues in food which are \\npassed on to the body. Those at higher risks are workers \\nhandling or producing pesticides as pesticides are toxic in \\nnature. The adverse effects of pesticide residues depend on \\nthe type and amount of the pesticide and the route (ingestion \\nor inhalation) and duration of exposure. If pesticide is used \\nin accordance with good agricultural practice, the residual \\nlevel would be low and consumption of such foods will not \\nbe harmful. Symptoms of acute poisoning include vomiting, \\ndiarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness and numbness. In severe \\ncases, it may lead to difficulties in breathing, blurred vision \\nand convulsion. Pesticides can cause damage to the brain \\nand nervous system, liver, kidneys and are specially harmful \\nto fetus. In India, FSSAI is responsible for setting maximum \\nresidue limits (MRLs) for the pesticides.\\nActivity 9.7\\n • Search any two cases \\nof food adulteration \\n(personal experience, \\nnews item, internet, \\netc.), identify \\nadulterant and its \\neffect on health. \\n • Whom can you \\napproach when you \\nsee fungus on bread; \\nsuspect water in milk \\nor find ice cream sold \\nafter the expiry date?\\n • Conduct a survey on \\n10 persons to assess \\ntheir actions on food \\nsafety asking simple \\nquestions like whether \\nthey check sign of \\nquality standard \\n(FSSAI, Agmark \\netc.), date of expiry, \\ningredients, visual \\ncondition of product, \\npackage, etc., while \\nbuying.

Growth is a natural \\nphenomenon. Growth is a characteristic feature of all living \\nbeings. You must have seen seeds growing into seedlings, which \\nthen grow and develop into plants, or pups growing into dogs, \\nkitten into cats and so on. Similarly an infant passes through \\ndifferent phases of growth from childhood to adolescence to \\nadulthood. Although all the stages of growth and development \\nare significant, it has been universally recognised that the \\nstage of adolescence is the most critical one. \\nThis chapter deals with the pattern of human growth with \\nspecial emphasis on the growth spurt that takes place during \\nadolescence which means by rapid changes in the body, \\npsyche and behaviour. An adolescent, well aware of pubertal \\nchanges, must be able to understand and accept the changes \\nwith confidence, and not fall into the trap of escapist strategies \\nsuch as drug abuse. Growing up with confidence needs proper \\nunderstanding of various issues and concerns related to \\nadolescence such as growth and development, self-concept \\nand self-esteem, anxiety and depression, nutritional needs \\nand sexual desires or any kind of harassment. Understanding \\nthese issues and concerns will help develop a positive attitude \\ntowards gender concerns and building healthy relationships.\\n2.2 Growth: A nAturAl Phenomenon \\nRecognition of adolescence as a distinct stage in the development \\nof human beings began during the early part of the 20th \\ncentury. Growth during adolescence is mostly portrayed as \\nan exclusive characteristic of this period, making one believe \\nthat growth during other stages — childhood, adulthood and \\nold age is hardly significant. But you would have observed \\nthat we have all been growing up since we were born without \\nconsciously realising it. We can appreciate the phenomenon \\nof growth during all stages of human life by undertaking the \\nfollowing activities.\\n2.2.1 What is Growth?\\nLet us understand what is growth?

Growth can be measured in terms \\nof the change in length, width, depth and volume in a specific \\ntime period. Although growth is a characteristic of living beings, \\nin all living beings, the rate of growth also depends on nutrition \\nand living conditions, including the environment at home.\\n2.2.2\\n Growth, Development and Maturation\\nGrowth, development and maturation occur side by side. \\nGrowth is a quantitative increase in \\nsize through increase in \\nnumber of cells or elongation of cells. Development may be \\ndefined as the progression of changes, both qualitative and \\nquantitative, which lead to an undifferentiated mass of cells to \\na highly organised state. Maturation is a measure of functional \\ncapacity. For example, a child begins to speak by making \\nunintelligible sounds. Then, slowly it acquires the capacity for \\nspeaking in a manner, which is easily understood by others. \\nAnother example of maturation is when a child begins to crawl \\nand then matures to a state of walking on two legs. Similarly, \\norgans of reproduction reach maturity at the end of puberty.\\n2.3 d etermInAnts of Growth And develoPment\\nAlthough age related events of growth, development and \\nmaturation in human beings are mostly the same in all cultures, \\nhowever, some variations do exist. This is because growth is \\naffected by both genetic and the environmental factors. Growth \\nis also influenced by the socio– cultural context. For example, \\nin the economically backward families, the growth of family \\nmembers gets stunted due to undernourishment. But even \\nin economically sound households, the members may not be \\ntaking a nutritious diet. Many children who eat junk food all the \\ntime become obese. In fact, growth and development of a human \\nbeing is a result of a combination of heredity and environment.\\nActIvIty 2.1\\n1.

Individual genes, however, are not solely \\nresponsible for growth, nor do they directly cause growth. \\nSeveral genes \\njointly control growth. The hormonal and nervous \\nsystems also have an important role to play. Hormones from \\nendocrine glands provide the requisite environment for gene \\naction throughout life. For example, growth spurt during \\nadolescence requires the secretion of adequate amounts of \\ngrowth hormones into blood so that the genes regulating growth \\nof skeleton, muscles and fat become active to the required \\nextent. Because of inheritance, children of tall parents are \\nlikely to be tall and children of short parents tend to be short. \\nOne needs to understand the role of heredity in the context \\nof development of body physique. Therefore, one should not \\ndevelop a negative or positive image of oneself on the basis \\nof one’s physique. Also, some individuals have a constitution \\nwhich makes them look tall (ectomorphic), some medium \\nsized (mesomorphic) and some have a small but rounded built \\n(endomorphic). Thus, a normally growing adolescent should \\nnot base self-image on these factors as they are beyond one’s \\ncontrol.\\n2.3.2\\n Role of Environment\\nGrowth and development are also influenced by environmental \\nfactors. The role of nutrition, child rearing \\npractices and the \\npsycho-social environment provided by the family is very critical. \\nNutrition: A nutritious diet favours growth. Growth requires \\nmultiplication of cells or enlargement of cells, which depends \\non an adequate supply of nutrients. In fact, at every stage, \\nthe body needs a basic level of nutrients for its sustenance. \\nNutrition is, therefore, the most important external factor for \\ngrowth. You have learnt in earlier classes in your science lessons \\nthat essential nutrients in a human diet are:\\n1.\\n Proteins and amino acids \\n2. Carbohydrates and sugar\\n3. Lipids – fats and oils \\n4. Minerals – Macronutrients: Calcium, Phosphorus, \\nSodium, Potassium, Sulphur, Chlorine, Magnesium. \\n \\nMicronutrients: Iron, Zinc, Manganese, Iodine, Cobalt, \\nCopper, Molybdenum, Nickel. \\n5.\\n Vitamins – Vitamins are of two kinds\\n Fat soluble: Vitamins A, D, E, K \\n Water soluble:  Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Folic Acid.\\n6.

Food provides energy, and energy \\n(in kilo calories) is required not only for growth but also for \\nmaintenance of the body, its working as well as reproduction.\\nA balanced diet contains all the nutrients in appropriate \\nquantities. Undernutrition during childhood results in slow \\ngrowth and delayed maturation. If continued into adolescence, \\nit leads to short stature adulthood. Nutritional needs during \\nadolescence are more than that during childhood. Dietary \\ndeficiencies retard the growth. The nutrient requirement \\nhowever varies among adolescents since rate of physical growth \\nis not the same in all. In populations with food shortage, growth \\nof children is delayed. They may be shorter or of less weight \\ndue to malnutrition or undernutrition. \\n2.3.3 \\n The Psycho-social environment\\nThe quality of emotional and psychological environment \\nin which a child lives \\nand grows do influence the hormonal \\nbalance of the body, thereby affecting growth.

Adolescence is a period \\nof losses—loss of childhood, loss of sexual innocence, loss \\nof freedom from responsibility. Adolescents need parental \\nsupport to cope with these losses. \\nPsychological security depends a lot on how a boy or girl \\nwas valued by the family as a child. You may have seen that \\nteenagers who have experienced encouragement from others \\nwith respect to values and parental expectations tend to be \\npsychologically more secure than those who are subjected as \\nchildren to shame and punishment. \\nA psychologically secure teenager \\nis able to concentrate on studies, \\nhave respect for parents, spend time \\njudiciously on hobbies and establish \\nhealthy relationships. Adolescence has to \\nbe viewed as a period of gains too— the \\nadolescent attains a beautiful physique, \\nfigure and face. Another gain is the \\nmaturity of brain, which leads to rational \\nthinking and better understanding of \\nsubjects and issues. But to ignore the \\nlosses and carry the gains forward, \\nsupport from parents/guardians, \\nteachers, and peers goes a long way in \\nhelping the youngsters cope with changes \\noccurring  during adolescence.\\nBox 2.3\\nDid you know?\\n\\uf09f\\t Awareness of \\npositive qualities \\nmakes one feel \\ngood and enhance \\nself-esteem.\\n\\uf09f\\t When we feel \\ngood, we respond \\nto every situation \\nmore positively.\\n\\uf09f\\t Appreciating \\nothers makes us \\nfeel good. \\nActIvIty 2.4\\nWrite ten sentences \\non ‘Me — in my own \\neyes’, in your diary. \\nAnalyse your writing. \\nDo you feel that you \\nhave desirable self-\\nesteem and self-\\nconfidence?

Depression at times leads to hostility towards \\nparents, society and peers. ‘Anger’ is sometimes a psychological \\nreaction for fighting depression. If an individual faces pressure, \\nhe/she should be empowered \\nto access or seek information, \\nadvice, support through appropriate communication from \\nsignificant adults such as the parents, teachers, elders, \\nrelatives, peers, counsellors and health professionals. The best \\nway to get out of depression is to engage oneself in various \\ntypes of physical activities and hobbies. \\n2.6.3\\n Psychosis \\nPsychosis is a medical term for a serious illness in which \\nthe patient loses contact with reality. The perception in the \\npatient’s mind has no connection \\nwith reality of the outside \\nworld.

As a result, \\nthe addicts are not able to undertake their responsibilities \\nand become a liability for their families. Furthermore, it is \\nexpensive to buy substances/drugs on a regular basis. Hence, \\nin desperation, addicted individuals may be forced to engage \\nin petty crimes. \\nThere can never be any need for drugs if one leads a \\nmeaningful life with nutritious food, physical exercise, yoga, \\nsatisfying occupation and healthy relationships. \\n2.8 s exuAl hArAssment or sexuAl ABuse \\nSexual harassment is described as any unwelcome sexual \\ngesture or behaviour, whether directly or indirectly–physical \\ncontact or advance, showing pornography, a demand or quest \\nfor sexual favour, or any other unwelcome physical, verbal/\\nnonverbal conduct. It also includes molestation and rape. It is \\na criminal act and a punishable offence. Young girls and boys \\noften become target of sexual harassment/abuse by older and \\npowerful people. As per the research, a person who is engaged \\nin sexual abuse of young girls and/or boys is often known to \\nthem. Boys are equally vulnerable to sexual abuse. The black \\nmailers usually threat the youngsters of serious consequences \\nif they tell anyone. In such cases, the girl/boy being abused \\nmust immediately inform parents/or any trusted member for \\nprotection.\\nBox 2.5\\nSaying ‘No’ with \\nconfidence is the \\nonly way to protect \\noneself from sexual \\nharassment.\\nRead about \\nProtection of \\nChildren from Sexual \\nOffence (POCSO) Act \\n2012 and Discuss \\nwith your classmates\\nChapter-2 Growing up with confidence.indd   26 08-11-2016   11:05:40 AM\\n2024-25'),\n",

But it takes \\ntime to reach them, during which if some initial care is taken, \\nit helps treatment of such individuals and in many cases \\nsaves their lives. We also observe that some of the minor \\nillnesses or injuries are cured by taking such initial care. \\nHowever, this care cannot be taken unless we are aware and \\ntrained in first-aid. In the present lesson we shall discuss \\nvarious aspects of first aid and safety.\\n12.2 What does FIrst aId Mean?\\nFirst aid is the provision of initial care for an illness or injury. \\nIt is usually performed by a non-expert person to a sick or \\ninjured person until appropriate medical treatment can be \\naccessed in a hospital or by going to a doctor. Certain self-\\nlimiting illnesses or minor injuries may not require further \\nmedical care after the first aid intervention. It generally \\nconsists of a series of simple and in some cases, potentially \\nlife-saving techniques that an individual can be trained to \\nperform with minimal equipment. \\nThe First aid training, therefore, is of value in both preventing \\nand treating sudden illness or accidental injury and in caring \\nfor large number of persons caught in a natural disaster. It is \\na measure both for self help as well as for the help of others. \\n12.2.1 Self-help\\nIf you, as a first-aider, are prepared to help others, you are \\nbetter able to care for yourself in case of injury or sudden \\nillness. Even if your own condition keeps you from caring for \\nyourself, you can direct others in carrying out correct \\nprocedures to follow on your behalf. \\n12.2.2 Help for Others\\nHaving studied first-aid, you are prepared to give others \\nsome instruction in first-aid, to promote among them \\na reasonable safety attitude and to assist them wisely \\nif they are stricken. There is always an obligation on a \\nhumanitarian basis to assist the sick and the helpless. \\nThere is no greater satisfaction than that resulting from \\nrelieving suffering or saving a life. \\nFirst Aid and Safety 12\\nFig. 12.1 : First Aid Box\\nactIvIty 12.1\\n•\\tMake\\ta\\tfirst\\taid\\tbox\\t\\nand keep in your \\nclassroom.\\n•\\tMake\\t one\\t student\\t\\nincharge so that \\nall students know \\nwhom to reach in \\nan emergency.\\nactIvIty 12.2\\n•\\tDo\\tyou\\tknow\\thow\\tto\\t\\napply bandage?\\n•\\tDo\\tyou\\tknow\\twhat\\t\\ntreatments are applied \\nfor bruises and cuts?\\n•\\tDiscuss\\tthe\\tabove\\tin\\tyour\\t\\nclass and demonstrate.\\n2024-25'),\n",

It is the \\ninitial assistance or care of a suddenly sick or \\ninjured person. It is the care administered by \\na person as soon as possible after an illness or \\naccident. It is this prompt care and attention \\nprior to the arrival of the ambulance that \\nsometimes creates the difference between life \\nand death, or between a full or partial recovery. \\nAs shown in Box 12.1, the major objectives \\nof first aid are: (i) to ensure that the victim \\nreaches the place of specialised treatment safely and life is not \\nlost in-between; (ii) to prevent further harm, i.e., the injury that \\nhas taken place, does not deteriorate further; (iii) to prevent \\nthe danger of further injury; and (iv) to promote recovery, i.e., \\nnecessary intervening care is taken in a way that promotes \\nrecovery and relieves the victim of pain and uneasiness.  \\n12.4 FIrst aId In dIFFerent cases\\nIt is essential to know and be trained in the art of providing \\nfirst aid. Though it is done by non-expert persons, it cannot \\nand should not be administered without acquiring adequate \\nknowledge and appropriate skill. There are different ways of \\nproviding first aid in different cases of accidents and illnesses. \\nLet us take some specific cases and know how first aid is \\nprovided.\\n12.4.1 First aid for Drowning\\nMany\\n\\tdeaths\\toccur\\tbecause\\tof\\tdrowning.\\tDeath\\tby\\tdrowning\\t\\noccurs when air cannot get into the lungs because of the \\nentrance of a small amount of water into the lungs. This may \\ncause the contraction of the throat. In such cases efforts \\nare made to remove water from the stomach of the drowned \\nperson. Attempting to forcefully remove water from the victim’s \\nstomach should be avoided as this \\nmay make the victim vomit \\nand there are chances of casualty. A casualty from drowning \\nneeds to be treated by a medical doctor, even if he/she seems \\nto recover, because, as explained in Box 12.2, a secondary \\ndrowning may occur in him/her at a later stage. \\nIn this particular situation, the aim of the first aid is to \\nrestore breathing, to keep the person warm and to arrange for \\ntaking  him/her to hospital. The following steps may be taken:\\nBox 12.1\\nThe basic objectives of First Aid are:\\n•\\t to give immediate care.\\n•\\t  to protect the casualty from \\nfurther harm.\\n•\\t  to relieve pain.\\n•\\t  to promote recovery.\\nThe recovery is promoted as the heart \\nrate goes down, which in turn \\nprevents \\nblood loss from the victim’s body.\\nBox 12.2\\nWater entering the \\nlungs causes them \\nto be irritated, and \\nthe air passages to \\nswell several hours \\nlater\\n —a condition \\nknown as secondary \\ndrowning.\\nChapter-12 First Aid & safety indd.indd   178 08-11-2016   11:48:16 AM\\n2024-25'),\n",

This is known as dry burn. The burn exposes \\nthe under lying part of the skin, which increases the \\nchances of infection. While assessing the burn, it is \\nnecessary to:\\n•\\t\\n consider the circumstances in which the burn \\nhas occurred;\\n•\\t\\n establish the cause of the burn;\\n•\\t  observe the condition of the victim; does she/he \\nneed immediate medical attention?\\n•\\t\\n assess the extent of burn or the depth of the \\nburn; and\\n•\\t  determine the degree of risk for infection.\\nBased on the depth of the skin damage, the burns are \\ncategorised into three types.\\nBox 12.3\\nWarning – Water in the lungs can \\nincrease the resistance to rescue \\nbreathes and chest compressions, so \\nthese have to be done at a slower rate. \\nHypothermia develops when the body \\ntemperature\\n\\t falls\\t bellow\\t 35°\\t Celsius.\\t\\nThe effects vary depending on the speed \\nof onset and the level to which the body \\ntemperature falls.\\nactIvIty 12.3\\nThe students should be encouraged to \\nask questions if they have any doubt \\non the procedure of the first aid in \\nswimming.

Gradually \\nhuman beings started organising events including games and \\nsports as community events. Consequently, the need was felt \\nto acquire specific skills and advancement in many sports. \\nEach sport has its specific skills which need to be developed \\nfor playing correctly. In this chapter we are going to discuss \\nhow some individual sports have evolved and how to develop \\nproficiency in playing these sports. Rules and regulations of \\nthese sports are revised from time to time by there federations.\\n6.2 BadmInton\\nBadminton is a game which is played by men, \\nwomen (Singles/Doubles) and both men and \\nwomen ( Mixed Doubles) together. It can be played \\nby persons of all ages. The first set of rules were \\nformulated in Pune, in India in 1901. These rules \\nwere gradually adopted by other nations. Due to this \\nreason, it is believed that badminton originated in \\nIndia. However, the game became an international \\nsport after the first All England Championship. \\nIn 1934, the International Badminton Federation \\n(IBF) was formed and the rules of the game were \\nstandardised. World Badminton Federation (WBF) \\nregulates the game. Badminton Association of India \\ncame into existence in 1934 and various State \\nBadminton Associations are affiliated to it.\\n6.2.1 Types of Events\\n•\\t  Singles (boys, girls), \\n•\\t  Doubles (boys, girls),\\n•\\t  Mixed Doubles (Combination of a boy and a girl)\\n6.2.2 Facilities and Equipment \\n•\\t  For playing badminton, a racket, net and shuttle cock  \\nare required.\\n•\\t  Court measurements: The length and width of the \\ndoubles court shall be of 13.40m × 6.10m.

The racket is held with \\na shake hand grip. The 'v' between the thumb and fore fingers \\nruns down the middle of the side of the handle as shown in \\nFig. 6.3. \\nBackhand Grip\\nIn this, the player holds the racquet in the \\nforehand grip. She/he then relaxes the grip \\nand moves her/his hand over the top edge of \\nthe handle until the thumb lies flat along the \\nback edge.  The strength is directly behind the \\nbackhand face of the racket. \\nFootwork\\nFootwork is an essential skill for Badminton. \\nBeing agile and flexible, enables a badminton \\nplayer move all over the court efficiently in \\naccordance with a Forehand, Backhand, \\nDrop, \\nDrive shot etc. and these are given below:\\nStrokes\\n•\\t  Forehand stroke - The stroke which is \\nhit from the right side of the body by the \\nright handed player.\\n•\\t\\n Backhand stroke - The stroke which is \\nhit from the left side of a right handed player.\\n•\\t\\n Smash - The player will jump upwards, sideways and \\nbackwards and the shuttle is hit (smashed) quickly and \\nforcefully downwards.\\nFig. 6.3 : Forehand Grip\\nChapter-6 Individuals Sports.indd   55 08-11-2016   11:36:27 AM\\n2024-25\"),\n",

To hit a top \\nspin the bat has \\nto be angled in such a way so that the forehand - side \\nfaces downward 40 degrees (closed face). \\n (b) To hit a back spin, angle of the bat should be upward \\nso that the forehand side faces the ceiling, facing \\nupward 45 degrees (open face). Swing \\nthrough the ball, \\nbut much speed should not be used as in topspin.\\n (c) A side spin is used in service. It is a combination of \\ntopspin and sidespin, or backspin and \\nsidespin in the \\nservice.\\nStrokes\\n (a) Strokes are generally offensive and defensive: while \\nperforming a stroke the player should stand close  \\nto the table and take a stance facing the line of play. Now  \\nusing a short stroke the racket arm should move from  \\nthe elbow in a horizontal plane while the free arm should  \\nmove upward. The strokes can be played with a backhand  \\npush and forehand push.\\nFig. 6.22 : Shake hand grip\\nFig. 6.23 : Pen Hold Grip\\nChapter-6 Individuals Sports.indd   73 08-11-2016   11:36:44 AM\\n2024-25'),\n",

With one key exception, the rules of the two styles are \\nidentical. \\nIn Greco-Roman, a wrestler may not attack his opponent’s \\nlegs, nor use his own legs to trip, lift or execute other moves. In \\nfreestyle, both the arms and legs may be used to execute holds \\nor to defend against attack. This style was introduced in 1904 \\nat St. Louis Olympic Games. After a century, women free style \\nwrestling was introduced in Athens Olympics in 2004. \\nIn addition to the above one more style of wrestling is \\nplayed in India which is called the Indian style of wrestling or \\notherwise known as Pehlwani or Kushti. This kind of wrestling \\ntakes place in a clay or a mud pit. Traditional Indian wrestling \\nisn’t just a sport, it’s an ancient sub-culture where wrestlers \\nlive and train together.\\n6.7.1\\n Equipment and Facilities for indoor (Fig. 6.24)\\n•\\t  Wrestling is an indoor sport played on a mat. \\n•\\t  The wresting area can be circle or \\nsquare in shape (12 \\nmetre ×12 metre).\\n•\\t  The thickness of the mat should be between 5 to 7  \\ncentimetres. \\n•\\t  The mats are covered with a non-abrasive vinyl material \\nwhich prevents slipping, injuries and is easy to clean.\\n•\\t\\n The bout is played on a yellow colour area with a diameter \\nof seven metres.\\n•\\t\\n The centre circle in the middle of the playing area is of \\none metre diameter, generally of red and white colour.\\nFig. 6.24 : Wrestling Ring\\nactIvIty 6.8\\nVisit an Akhada \\nand write your \\nobservations.\\n6.7.2\\n How to Wrestle\\n•\\t  The sport of wrestling is played \\nin \\ndifferent weight categories for \\nboth boys and girls.

Basketball is one of the world’s most popular game. \\nIt is a fast, free-flowing, high-scoring team game. The players \\nthrow a ball in a basket horizontally positioned to score points \\nwhile following a set of rules. Two teams play on a marked \\nrectangular court with a basket at each end.  The rules allow \\nall players to move freely around the court and occupy any \\nposition on the court. All players get an equal opportunity to \\nscore basket. The way in which the game is re-started after a \\npoint is scored or a rule infringement makes it a fast game with \\nfew breaks in between regulation timing. To play this game, \\nstudents should learn and practise the basic skills of ball \\ndribbling, passing, receiving and shooting. Game of basketball \\ninvolves neuromuscular coordination and often tall players are \\npreferred.\\n7.2.1  History\\nThe game of basketball was originated at the Springfield College \\nof Physical Education Massachusetts, USA in 1891 by Dr \\nJames Naismith. In 1894 Naismith drew up the first 13 rules, \\nwhich still form the basis of modern basketball rules. In India, \\nthe YMCA at Kolkata introduced basketball some 80 years \\nago. Later the YMCA established at Chennai in 1920 played an \\nimportant role in the development of this game. Now-a-days \\nbasketball is one of the most favourite games in many schools \\nand colleges. The game is played by both men and women of \\nall ages and abilities.

The other team \\nbowls and fields, trying to dismiss the batsmen and \\nthus limiting the runs scored by the batting team. \\nRun can be scored by the striking batsman hitting \\nthe ball with the bat, running to the opposite end of \\nthe pitch and touching the crease there without being \\ndismissed.

An England \\nteam toured India in 1902-03. An All-India team went on a \\ntour of England in 1911 under Maharaja Bhupinder Singh \\nof Patiala. The Indian Cricket Control Board came into being \\ntowards the end of 1928.

During \\nan Inning, one team fields and the other bats. The two \\nteams switch between fielding and batting after each \\nInning. \\n•\\t\\n All eleven members of the fielding team take the field, \\nbut only two members of the batting team are on the field \\nat any given time. The fielding team’s eleven members \\nstand outside the pitch, spread out across the field. \\n•\\t\\n Behind each batsman is a target called a wicket. One \\ndesignated member of the fielding team, called the \\nbowler, is given a ball, and he attempts to deliver (bowl) \\nthe ball. If the bowler succeeds in hitting the wicket (Fig. \\n7.9), or if the ball, after being struck by the batsman, is \\ncaught by the fielding team before it touches the ground, \\nthe batsman is out. \\n•\\t If the batsman is successful in striking the ball and \\nthe ball is not caught before it hits the ground, the two \\nbatsmen may then try to score runs for their team by \\nrunning across the pitch. Each crossing and grounding \\nby both batsmen is worth one run. The batsmen may \\nattempt multiple runs or select not to run at all.\\n•\\t\\n If the batsman hits the bowled ball over the field \\nboundary without the ball touching the field, the batting \\nteam scores six runs. If the ball touches the ground and \\nthen reaches the boundary, the batting team scores four \\nruns. \\nactIvIty 7.5\\nHow\\tdo\\tyou\\tthink\\t\\nthat cricket can \\nbe played in other \\nrecreational form(s)? \\nexplain.\\nactIvIty 7.4\\n•\\t What is the full \\nform of IPL?\\n•\\t Write about your \\nobservation of any \\ncricket match.\\n•\\t Discuss with \\nyour friends, any \\ncricket match you \\nhave seen.\\n•\\t Write health \\nrelated advantage \\nof playing cricket.\\nFig. 7.9 : Out\\nChapter-7 Team Games indd.indd   86 18-11-2016   4:39:22 PM\\n2024-25'),\n",

By now you \\nmust have realised that health does not only mean freedom \\nfrom diseases. It is much more. Health is the state of physical, \\nmental and social well-being. It should be viewed in a holistic \\nway.  An individual may be physically and mentally healthy, \\nbut if her/his social condition is problematic, she/he cannot \\nachieve holistic health. In the present chapter, we shall focus \\non various aspects of social health.\\n13.2 What Is socIal health?\\nLet us first understand the meaning of social health. We know \\nthat social health is one of the three major components of \\nhealth, the other two being physical and mental. Social health \\ncan be defined in two ways.  In one sense, it refers to the \\nhealth of a person with reference to her/his ability to interact \\nwith others. It also refers to the health of a society in general. \\nIt focuses on how the members of a society treat each other \\nand behave with each other. What kind of social environment \\nprevails and how the prevailing customs and traditions guide \\nthe behaviour of individuals towards self, each other and \\ntowards the society as a whole also form social health. Social \\nHealth also includes how individual’s natural environment \\naround them is. The role of the community as a whole acquires \\ngreat importance for enhancing and maintaining the quality of \\nthe health of individuals. Although there are many dimensions \\nof social health, we shall discuss below the impact of social \\ncustoms on our health, the need to protect natural resources \\nand the empowerment of community for healthy living.\\n13.3 Impact of socIal customs \\nCustoms and traditions prevalent in a society influence all \\naspects of the lives of individuals, including their health and \\nwelfare. What people eat, how they eat, how they live and care \\nfor their own health as well as the health of their near and dear \\nones are influenced by the prevailing customs and traditions. \\nLet us first understand the meaning of the term custom.\\n13.3.1 What is a Custom?\\nCustoms generally refer to beliefs, habits or actions performed \\nin the past and transmitted through time from one generation \\nSocial Health 13\\nactIvIty 13.1\\nMake a list of \\ncustoms having a \\npositive and negative \\nimpact on the health \\nof individual and \\nsociety prevailing in \\nyour neighbourhood. \\nShare with your \\nclassmates their \\nimplications on \\nhealth?\\n2024-25'),\n",

These are derived from social norms which are \\nrules or standards that guide, control or regulate proper and \\nacceptable behaviour of a group. These norms define the shared \\nexpectations of a group and enable people to anticipate how \\nothers will interpret and respond to their words and actions \\nif there is a deviation from these norms. For example, there \\nare customs and traditions related to marriage ceremonies. \\nThese are observed by not only those who are getting married \\nbut also by the other members of the family and community. \\nMany of the customs have positive impact on the relationships \\nin a family and community. However, many of the customs \\nhave negative impact as well. For example, there are customs \\nprevalent in many communities, like early marriage or \\ndiscriminating against female child, or choice of spouse, which \\nadversely affect the health and well-being not only of the female \\nchild but of the society as a whole.   \\n13.3.2 Customs and Health \\nIn every society, the individuals, \\nfamilies and communities observe \\nmany customs that have direct \\nbearing on health. From the \\nmoment of birth of a child, customs \\nbegin to shape experiences and \\nbehaviour of the child. In reality, \\nby the time children can think \\nindependently, the health-related \\ncustoms of the family have already \\nbecome an intimate part of their \\npersonalities. They do not question \\nthese customs, as they are deeply \\nheld and protected by the society. \\nIt becomes extremely difficult to \\nchange them. Let us understand \\nthis by considering what happened \\nto Seema.\\nThe experiences of Seema \\nshows the negative impact of social \\ncustoms on health. \\nLet us consider the influence \\nof customs on the thinking and \\nbehaviour of individuals in respect \\nof early marriage, breastfeeding \\npractices, family size, preference for \\nmale child and substance abuse. All \\nthese affect family and community \\nhealth.  \\nactIvIty 13.2\\nSeema studies in Class IX in a small town. She \\nhas two elder brothers.

On the \\nother hand, parents tell Seema that she should \\neat less, otherwise she will look too grown up \\nand big for her age.  One day, while in class, \\nSeema told her teacher that she was feeling \\ndizzy.  Before the teacher could do anything, \\nshe fainted. The teacher took her to a nearby \\nhospital and then went home with her.

The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1978 \\nstipulates legal age of marriage as 18 for girls and 21 for boys, \\nbut social customs encourage early marriage even now. You may \\nhave heard the word kanyadan. Influenced by \\nprevailing customs, many parents consider \\nit good to marry their daughters even before \\nshe attains puberty. The tradition of dowry is \\nanother factor for early marriage in India.  It is \\nbelieved that dowry will be lower if the bride is \\nyounger in age.  \\nThe early marriage custom puts pressure \\non young married women to prove their \\nfertility resulting in high rates of adolescent \\npregnancy. Adolescent pregnancy leads to \\ngreater health risks for the teenage mother \\nand her child. Biologically, she is yet to attain \\nreproductive maturity. There are chances of \\nprolonged labour that can result in severe \\ndamage to the reproductive tract. The available \\nevidence suggests that maternal deaths \\nare considerably higher among adolescent \\nmothers than among mature mothers. The \\nbabies born to adolescent mothers generally \\nhave low birth-weight. Such babies are more \\nlikely to die at birth or in infancy. Early \\npregnancy increases the risk of maternal \\nand child morbidity and mortality. Early \\npregnancy also has serious psychological, \\nsocial and economic consequences. \\nIt continues to affect adversely the \\neducational, economic and social \\nstatus of women and is likely to \\nhave negative impact on the quality \\nof life of the family. \\nIn many cases, young girls are \\nmarried to older men. Such girls \\ndo not have the courage to take \\ndecisions related to family needs, \\nlack power and are more likely \\nto experience partner violence.  \\nNational Family Health Survey \\n(NFHS-3, 2005, 2006) reveals that \\n27 per cent young women and   \\nFig. 13.1 : Child Marriage is Illegal\\nThis poster has been designed by Shivani Sharma from \\nClass X, KP ISP Nasik, Maharasthra\\nactIvIty 13.3\\nRead the case study given below and reflect \\non the question.\\nI am Munni.

But some customs do \\nhave positive impact, for example, \\nconsider the issue related to \\nbreastfeeding. We are aware that \\ntraditionally mothers breastfeed \\ntheir infants for a year or two and \\nsometimes even longer. This has \\nbeen an accepted norm. But now-\\na-days, due to paucity of time \\nand as a matter of convenience, \\nsome mothers do not breastfeed \\ntheir infants. Life style concern \\nalso comes in the way of breast \\nfeeding. They choose to shift to \\npowdered or bottled milk as a \\nsubstitute for breast milk. Today \\nan increasing number of women \\nare working outside their homes \\nand bottle feeding seems to be \\nconsidered a more convenient \\noption for them. Those who \\nchoose to breastfeed are looked \\ndown upon. Breastfeeding in \\npublic is also not an acceptable \\noption.\\nHowever, there are two \\nsignificant needs, which make \\nbreastfeeding important both \\nfor the mother as well as the \\nchild. One is nutritional while \\nthe other is psychological. \\nWhile the nutritional benefit of \\nbreastfeeding is no doubt very \\nimportant, the psychological \\nbonding which develops between \\nthe child and the mother due \\nto breastfeeding is unparalleled \\nand has a positive impact on the \\nhealth of both.\\nactIvIty 13.4\\nFind answers to the following questions\\n•\\t In which of the Indian States do we find a \\nlarge number of girls being married before \\nthey attain the legal age of marriage?\\n•\\t\\n Have you ever thought how early marriage \\naffects both boys and girls, more particularly \\nthe girls?

These nutrients are essential for \\nthe healthy growth and development of the child.  In fact, the \\ncaloric density, protein, carbohydrate and fat in breast milk are \\nvery important for the growth of the child.  Breast milk is free \\nfrom contamination by bacteria and is easier for the infant’s \\nstomach to digest.  Infants who are breastfed for at least eight \\nmonths have reduced incidence of many diseases. The first \\nsecretion from the mother’s breast after the birth of the infant \\nis known as colostrum. Scientific studies have shown that it \\nis extremely good for the new born. But in some communities \\nthe mother is asked not to feed this fluid to the child, as they \\nignorantly think it to be impure. Such customs with a negative \\nimpact should be discouraged by creating awareness.  \\nFamily Size, Preference for Male Child\\nAnother set of customs and tradition that have adverse impact \\non social health is related to family size. Many people believe \\nthat child birth is a gift of God and individuals should not \\ninterfere with this divine process.  People also have preference \\nfor male child. Many a time parents go on giving birth to \\nchildren, and the size of the family continues to grow, until a \\nmale child is born. This belief contributes to increasing number \\nof children in the family. Some parents want to have at least \\ntwo male children. The preference for male child has been the \\nmain cause of discrimination against girls. Girls are considered \\ninferior to boys. Owing to discrimination, nutritional needs of \\ngirls are not met adequatly. All food items that are served to \\nboys are not given to girls or are given in very less quantity. \\nThe girls are also discriminated in availing education facilities. \\nIn the process, girls are married off very early.\\nThe discrimination against females has been a grave \\nproblem in our society. You must have read about the inverse \\nsex ratio being a problem in our country as discused earlier. \\nParents get the pregnancy test done in a clinic and if they find \\nit to be a female foetus, they get it aborted.

Substance abuse can adversely affect an \\nadolescent’s psychological and social development. \\n13.4 protectIon of natural resources\\nThe environment is a key determinant of social and individual \\nhealth. You may be aware that many of our health problems are \\ncaused by environmental degradation. Exposure to air, water \\nand soil pollution, chemicals in the environment, or noise, can \\ncause cancer, respiratory, cardiovascular and communicable \\ndiseases, as well as some other serious health disorders. \\nAlthough environmental degradation can affect the health of \\nthe whole population, some groups are particularly vulnerable, \\nincluding children, pregnant women, the elderly and persons \\nwith pre-existing family history of certain diseases. Recall what \\nyou have learnt in the chapter on water management.\\nAs you are aware that number of factors contribute to \\nenvironmental degradation, but the most important factor is \\nthe misuse and over use of natural resources.  All that the \\nnature has provided to us such as soil, air, water, minerals, \\nsunshine (sunlight), animals and plants, etc., are known \\nas natural resources. Human beings use these directly or \\nindirectly for their survival and welfare. The problem lies in \\nhow these natural resources are distributed and used. If at \\nany time one person or a group of people uses more than their \\nfair share of resources, an imbalance is created. This leads to \\nenvironmental health problems for others.\\nIt is, therefore, essential for every individual to ensure \\nthat natural resources are protected and are not misused \\nor over used, so that social and individual health is not \\naffected adversely. In India, we have had a great tradition of \\nenvironmental conservation. We have been taught since ages to \\nrespect nature and to recognise that all forms of life — human, \\nanimal and plant are closely interrelated. Disturbance in one \\ngives rise to an imbalance in others. Our Constitution also \\nhas provisions for protection of environment. \\n13.4.1 Clean Water and Food Resources\\nIn view of the above, all the natural resources need to be \\nprotected. It can be done in two ways. Efforts are needed \\nto ensure that natural resources are used judiciously \\naccording to the needs of the present generation, and of \\nfuture generations. Secondly, care needs to be taken so that \\nnatural resources are properly maintained and sustained. \\nWe may take the examples of water and food resources.\\nactIvIty 13.8\\nDesign an \\nadvertisement for \\ncommunity members \\nto say no to drug \\nabuse.

Improvement of physical fitness: The performance \\nin sports generally depends upon physical fitness of a \\nsports person. Every sport activity needs specific type of \\nphysical fitness, and hence, the improvement of various \\ncomponents of physical and skills related fitness like \\nstrength, speed, coordination, endurance and flexibility \\nis an important aim and objective of sports training.\\n2.\\n Acquisition of sports skills: This includes motors skills \\nas well as basic movement skills. Fundamental motor \\nskills are prerequisites to the learning of sport-specific \\nskills. Every \\nsports activity requires to observe certain \\nspecific movement procedure to tackle a particular task. \\nThis movement procedure is known as technique and \\nwhen this technique is learnt and perfected, it leads to \\nskill development. Whenever sports persons include in \\ntechnical training, they focus on acquisition of motor \\nskills relevant to a particular sport. Fundamental motor \\nskills such as hopping, jumping, skipping, kicking, \\nthrowing, catching and striking are prerequisites to the \\nlearning of sport specific skills of basketball, football, \\ngymnastics, tennis, cricket, badminton etc. \\n3.\\n Improvement of tactical efficiency:  Tactical training \\nis designed to improve various strategies and is based \\nupon analysis of the tactics of opponents. Specific \\ntraining in \\nsports helps the sports persons to make \\nthe best use of their abilities and techniques so that \\nthe chances of success in competition are increased. \\nThe training develops three kinds of tactics: offensive, \\ndefensive and high performance tactics. Tactical \\nefficiency is enhanced by providing the sports persons \\nwith knowledge of rules and repeated opportunities to \\nperfect tactical abilities in them.\\n4.\\n Improvement of mental abilities are critical for high \\nlevel performance in any sport. The training aims at \\ndevelopment of positive attitude towards sports and \\ncompetition, dedication and devotion towards particular \\nsport or event, sincerity and honesty, self-confidence \\nand optimum level of aspiration. \\n5.5 c haracterIStIcS of SportS traInIng\\nSome of the important characteristics of sports training are:\\n1. Sports Training is Individual-specific:  The needs of \\nevery individual for performing in a particular sport are \\ndifferent from those of another.

The difference depends on individual-specific \\ncapabilities. It is, therefore, necessary to identify the \\nindividual potential during the training. By identifying \\ntheir needs, training may be focused at improving the \\nidentified gaps in the abilities of that sports person.\\n2.\\n To Achieve High Performance in a \\nSports \\nCompetition: The important feature of sports training \\nis its focus on enabling the sportsperson to achieve \\nthe highest possible level of performance in any of the \\nsports competitions. It is a process which is spread over \\na long period of time.                                                                                          \\n3.\\n Sports Training is a Scientific Process: It is highly \\ninfluenced by the scientific methods, to achieve best \\nresult the knowledge from various dimensions of \\nsciences has to be incorporated during the process of \\ntraining. \\n4.\\n Coach has an Important Role: A coach helps in \\nbuilding confidence, boosts morale and \\nacts as a friend \\nand a mentor. A coach is like a ‘philosopher and mentor’ \\non the sports field.\\n5.\\n Optimum Development of Sports Persons: To achieve \\noptimum performance sports training should be \\nplanned, systematic and scientific and to achieve same, \\ndifferent means and methods are used. These means and \\nmethods are constantly modified and used in different \\nconditions. \\nSports, training is a continuous process for \\noptimum development and perfection of sports persons.\\n6. Sports training is an Educational Process: Sports \\ntraining is basically an educational process and it \\ndevelops all the aspects of personality. High performance \\nis not possible without developing the personality \\nbecause both aspects are inter-related and inter-\\ndependent of sports training.  \\n \\n7. Sports training is a Process of Development of \\nHidden Talent: The training helps in observing and \\nassessing the performance level of the player at any \\ngiven moment. While doing so the hidden talent in a \\nsportsperson is identified. This talent \\nis systematically \\nnurtured through the required specific training inputs.\\n5.6 MethodS of SportS traInIng?\\nThere are various methods of sports training that are mentioned \\nbelow:\\n•\\t Continuous Training Method •\\t Circuit Training Method\\n•\\t Interval Training Method •\\t Plyometric Training  \\n Method\\nChapter-5 Sports Trainingindd.indd   48 08-11-2016   11:19:44 AM\\n2024-25'),\n",

Hence, too \\nlong a break in the training should be avoided and the \\ncondition of optimum load should be created.\\n2.\\n Increasing the Training Load: there is a relationship \\nbetween the load and adaptation process. Training load \\nshould be gradually increased to enable the body, to \\nadapt higher demands progressively. \\n3.\\n Active Participation: It is a well known fact that a \\nplayer who is passively engaged in the training does not \\ndevelop abilities and always remains totally dependent \\nupon the coach or the physical education teacher and \\nnever develops confidence or improves performance \\ncapabilities. Therefore the teacher/coach must ensure \\nthat the sports persons participate in the training with \\nconviction and sincerity.\\n4.\\n Planned and Systematic Training: To achieve a high \\nlevel of sports performance in \\ncompetitions, the training \\nmust be well planned and conducted in a systematic \\nmanner for better results. \\n5.\\n General and specific training: Both general and \\nspecific training of a sports person are equally important \\nbecause general training creates the base and specific \\ntraining helps to achieve high performance.

Adaptability: The adaptability to the training load \\nshould be in proper proportion between the load and \\nrecovery. Then only a sports person gets adapted to  the \\ntraining load. \\n11.\\n Uniformity and differentiation: The uniformity \\nmay be in terms of time and duration of the activity, \\nwhereas, the load may vary as per the capacity of \\nthe individual sportsperson. It is an established fact \\nthat no two individuals are alike. The sports persons \\nparticipating in the training are different in terms of age, \\nhealth condition, individual capacity, recovery \\npace and \\nphysique.

The \\nvarious food items that we consume constitute our diet. Diet \\nmay be defined as the total amount of different variety of food \\nitems consumed by a person during a day. \\nA healthy diet should consist of simple, natural and/or \\nwell-cooked foods which promote health and protect us from \\ndiseases. It should keep our organ systems well functioning. \\nThe diet that we consume is decided by our socio-cultural \\nnorms, life style pattern and the type of activities we are engaged \\nin.

These constituents \\nare known as nutrients. For proper functioning of our \\nbody we need to consume body building foods (e.g. \\nmilk, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, pulses, groundnuts); \\nenergy giving foods (e.g. cereals, sugar, roots, fats and \\noils); and protective foods (e.g. vegetables, fruits). \\n11.2.1 Nutrients             \\nThe  food we consume breaks down to simpler \\nproducts before it is absorbed and utilised by the \\nbody. These simpler substances are called nutrients. \\nOur body utilises nutrients for building and repairing, \\nobtaining energy and for protection from diseases. \\nWhat is nutrition? The term nutrition is related to \\nour food intake and dietary patterns and utilisation of \\nprotein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins and minerals to maintain \\nour health. Most of the natural food items contain more than \\none nutrient.  Let us understand various nutrients contained \\nin different food items.\\n11.2.1.1 Proteins  \\nProteins are called building blocks of our body.  About 20 \\nper cent of our body weight comes from proteins. Proteins \\nare essential for growth and repair of muscle and other body \\ntissues. Proteins are made of amino acids that contain the \\nelements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. We obtain \\nproteins from animal as well as vegetable sources. Proteins of \\nanimal origin are found in milk, eggs, cheese, fish and meat. \\nProteins from these sources contain all the essential amino \\nacids (EAA) in adequate amounts. Vegetable proteins are found \\nFig 11.1 :  A Vegetarian Thali\\nactIvIty 11.2\\nFind out from \\nyour parents/ \\ngrandparents, the \\nlocally available \\nfruits and their \\nvalue to the health \\nof the body.\\nFig 11.2 : Protein rich food items\\nChapter-11 diet for health living .indd   162 08-11-2016   11:46:37 AM\\n2024-25'),\n",

There are three major categories of \\ncarbohydrates, viz. starch, sugar and cellulose. Our \\nbody breaks down sugar and starch into glucose to \\nprovide energy. Cellulose does not have any nutritive \\nvalue per se, but is a major contributor of dietary \\nfibres. Excess carbohydrates are converted into fat by \\nthe liver and stored in the adipose tissues in our body. \\nCarbohydrates\\n\\t are\\t of\\t two\\t types\\t –\\t simple\\t and\\t\\ncomplex. Simple carbohydrates are quick energy \\nfoods, e.g. sugar. Sources of simple \\ncarbohydrates are \\nnatural fruits, milk and milk products, and vegetables \\nincluding potatoes and carrots. Complex carbohydrates \\nare better sources of energy than sugar since these are \\nreleased slowly. Sources of complex carbohydrates are \\nbreads, cereals (rice, wheat, bajra, corn, barley, ragi, \\netc.). We should consume starch and natural sugar \\nand eat whole grains, rice, bread, cereals and fruits to \\nobtain adequate amount of carbohydrates. Fast food \\nitems such as pizza, pasta, noodles, etc. are rich in \\ncarbohydrates only and cannot replace a balanced \\nmeal. \\n11.2.1.3 Fats\\nFats and oils are concentrated sources of energy. Fats \\nare substances that our body stores for future use. \\nThese are classified as simple lipids (e.g. triglycerides), \\ncompound lipids (e.g. phospholipids), and derived \\nlipids (e.g. cholesterol). Fats may be obtained from animal \\nor vegetable sources. The major sources of animal fats are \\nghee, butter, milk, cheese, eggs, fish and meat. The sources of \\nvegetable oils are groundnut, mustard, sesame, coconut, etc. \\nExcess carbohydrates are converted into fats. Fast food items \\nlike pizza, samosas, burgers are rich sources of fat. Therefore, \\nchildren who consume only fast food items tend to become \\nobese. \\n11.2.1.4 Vitamins\\nVitamins are organic substances that we require in adequate \\nquantities for good health. Our body, however, cannot \\nsynthesise them. Therefore, we need to consume their natural \\nsources such as fruits and vegetables. Vitamins are divided \\nFig 11.3 : Carbohydrates and Vitamins\\nChapter-11 diet for health living .indd   163 08-11-2016   11:46:39 AM\\n2024-25'),\n",

Girls need more minerals \\nlike calcium and iron. Adolescent girls and boys need to take \\ncalcium rich food to keep their bones, teeth and muscles \\nhealthy; and iron rich food  to keep them strong. Therefore, it \\nis essential for them to consume more dairy products, beans  \\nand green leafy vegetables in their diet. Young girls taking \\ninadequate diet may suffer from nutritional problems like iron-\\ndeficiency anaemia and  obesity. This may be due to refusal to \\neat food to maintain weight or binge eating habit. Furthermore, \\nan under nourished adolescent girl is at a risk of developing \\ncomplication during pregnancy and child birth.\\n11.4.2 Diet for Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers\\nWomen always require more iron than men. Pregnant and \\nlactating mothers have special dietary needs. In our country, \\nit is seen that pregnant and lactating women do not take \\nhealthy diet because of lack of availability and lack of \\nimportant nutritional information. A pregnant and a lactating \\nmother requires additional energy over and above her normal \\nrequirements. There is also an increased need for protein, \\ncalcium and iron. Inadequate intake of nutrients causes \\nharm to the foetus and the child. Mothers should follow the \\nguidelines for intake of nutrients available from the nearby \\nhealth centre and gather knowledge regarding weight gain and \\nsupplementation. Besides food, normal physical activities and \\nlight exercises like walking should be performed by pregnant \\nwomen in consultation with the doctor or health worker.  \\nGood nutrition during pregnancy promotes healthy weight \\nof the newborn. Low birth-weight children are prone to various \\ndiseases during adulthood. Therefore, pregnant women and \\nmothers should keep the following in mind. \\n•\\t\\n Include all food groups in daily diet.

For \\ninstance, there is now an increasing use of non-biodegradable \\nmaterials such as plastics, metals and glass, specifically in \\nurban areas. \\nTechnological advancement has further brought in an \\nincreasing use of electronic items and gadgets. These are useful \\nfor us, but when discarded (known as E-Waste) they can be \\nharmful to the environment and human health, particularly \\nfor the workers associated with this occupation.\\nIn addition, we seem to have lost our aesthetic and civic \\nsense, and carelessly litter garbage around on the roads, in the \\nmarket-place, in open drains, ponds, rivers, seas, and so on. \\nIn fact, we keep throwing a lot of garbage everyday. Have you \\never thought what will happen if the garbage is not removed \\nfrom our homes and surroundings? Where does this garbage \\nultimately go and what is done with it?  If proper measures \\nfor disposal and sanitation are not followed, how will garbage \\naffect our environment and health?\\n10.3.1 Consequences of Solid Waste Disposal \\nIn the cities and towns, collection of garbage is the responsibility \\nof the respective municipalities. The garbage then goes through \\na process of segregation, treatment and final disposal in the \\nlandfills. This process of segregation in our country is still \\ndone manually by rag pickers. (See Fig. 10.1). In this process, \\nmaterials that can be recycled are separated, while toxic wastes \\nare sorted out and kept separately. This process of segregation \\nensures that the amount of solid waste, which is ultimately \\ndisposed of in the landfills, is reduced substantially.\\nBox 10.1\\nIn your history textbook \\nyou must have studied how \\narchaeologists record the lives \\nof ancient societies through the \\nmaterial remains left behind \\nby them.

When we eat the food, \\nwhich has been contaminated by these \\nflies, we are likely to fall ill.

Segregation at Source\\nThe first and most important principle for waste management \\nis segregation at source. Segregation of garbage at source \\nshould be practised at home, at school, office and markets. \\nGarbage can be disposed of in separate bins (Fig 10.4). Blue \\nbins may be used for non-biodegradable and green bins for \\nbiodegradable waste. \\nAt home, you may segregate waste into the following \\ncategories. \\n(a) Wet waste, (b) dry waste, (c) hazardous waste. \\nIn the cities we find these bins in some places, where \\npeople can dispose of biodegradable and non-biodegradable \\ngarbage separately. Where do you think we should dispose of \\nhazardous waste? Should there be a separate bin for it? Why?\\n2. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Refuse\\nWe should segregate waste products with a view to reduce, \\nreuse, recycle and refuse. In Activity 10.3 you have seen that \\nthere are different types of waste that are generated in our \\nhomes. For most of us, kitchen wastes (fruit peels, vegetables, \\nleftover food, tea leaves) forms a large percentage of the total \\nwaste at home. Composting is a common method to reduce the \\nvolume of kitchen waste to ‘zero waste.’ It is also an effective \\nway through which kitchen waste can be recycled back into \\nnature. \\nThere are certain items in our garbage that can be reused. \\nReusing discarded items means that instead of dumping them \\nand increasing the load of waste, we can reuse these items.  \\nSome examples are given here.\\nFig. 10.4 : Blue and Green Bins\\nChapter-10 Waste Managementindd.indd   157 08-11-2016   11:44:59 AM\\n2024-25'),\n",

We \\ncannot imagine a person to be healthy without being physically \\nfit. Physical fitness, therefore needs to be appreciated in full \\nmeasure.

Another significant issue is whether there is a universal \\ncondition of physical fitness which is uniformly applicable to \\nall. It is not so. Physical fitness of young people is different \\nfrom that of the aged. The physical fitness of a sports person \\nis different from that of the persons working in army factory \\nor a layman. In fact, physical fitness means different things to \\ndifferent people.

Physical fitness is considered as a measure of \\nthe body’s ability to function efficiently and effectively during \\nwork and leisure activities. In order to remain physically fit \\nand healthy, we need to engage ourselves in physical activities \\nand take measures for physically fit.\\nPhysical fitness is an important area of discussion as the \\nnumber of childrens becoming obese. The normal physical \\nactivities, which were done in earlier times both at home and \\noutside as part of day-to-day routine have reduced due to \\ndevelopment of science and technology. The work that was \\ndone manually is now being carried out by machines. The \\nuse of automated equipment such as automatic machines, \\nremotes, mobiles and changes in lifestyles affect health and \\nphysical fitness. It has become a matter of deep thinking  for \\nall of us. \\nNow a days we find increased marketing of packaged food \\nand diet for physical fitness. Many such health products now \\nare advertised on TV and radio, and in newspapers, booklets  \\nand magazine. It is important for all of us to understand that \\nphysical fitness cannot be achieved without doing physical \\nexercise regularly. We should not resort to any shortcut that \\nPhysical Fitness\\nBox 4.1\\nPhysical fitness is \\nthe body’s ability to \\nfunction efficiently \\nand effectively in \\nwork and leisure \\nactivities.

Start slowly with an activity you enjoy, and \\ngradually work up increase to a more intense pace.\\nMuscular Strength is the amount of force applied on \\nmuscle or muscle groups, is able to exert for one maximal \\neffort (contraction).The key to making your muscles stronger is \\nworking them against resistance, whether that be from weights \\nor gravity. If you want to gain muscle strength, try excercises \\nsuch as lifting weights (under proper supervision).\\nMuscular Endurance is the ability of a muscle or muscle \\ngroup to exert force against a submaximal load for a given \\nlength of time (or number of repetition) before fatiguing to the \\npoint of failure.\\nBody Composition refers to the proportion of team body \\nmass to body fat, it includes amount of muscle, fat, bone, and \\nother vital parts of the body. Body composition is important to \\nbe considered for health and managing the body fat. \\nFlexibility is the range of motion around a joint. Good \\nflexibility in the joints can help prevent injuries through all \\nstages of life. If you want to improve your flexibility, try yoga, \\ngymnastics and basic stretching exercise programme.\\n4.4.2\\n Components of Skill-related Fitness\\nAgility is the ability to change and control the direction \\nand position of the body while maintaining a constant, rapid \\nmotion. For example changing directions to hit a tennis ball. \\nBalance is the ability to control or stabilise the body when \\na person is standing still or moving. For example, handstand \\nin gymnastics. \\nCoordination is the ability to use the senses together \\nwith body parts during movement. For example, dribbling a \\nbasketball.
